First Federal Inmate Dies of Covid-19, Deepening Fear of Coronavirus Spread in Prisons</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Sadie Gurman </pre>
<p>
     The first federal inmate has died from the novel coronavirus, the Bureau of Prisons said Saturday, fueling concerns of an outbreak throughout the nation&apos;s lockups. </p>
<p>
     The man, who had been serving a sentence for a drug conviction at a low-security facility in Oakdale, La., was transferred to a hospital on March 19 after complaining of a persistent cough, the bureau said. He tested positive for the virus and was put on a ventilator a day later when his symptoms worsened. </p>
<p>
     Hospital staff pronounced him dead Saturday. The bureau identified him as 49-year-old Patrick Jones and said he had long-term, pre-existing health conditions that put him at risk for developing a more severe case of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     The announcement came as the bureau is grappling with how to slow the spread of the disease among correctional officers and prisoners. The bureau--which has 122 facilities--said Saturday that 14 inmates and 13 staffers had tested positive across the country, with correctional officers warning those numbers could quickly rise. </p>
<p>
     Prison officials said the measures they are imposing include a 14-day quarantine for new inmates, taking their temperatures and isolating those who show symptoms. But health experts say it is almost impossible to keep inmates completely safe in facilities where they live in close quarters, spend time together in recreation areas, dine together, share bathrooms, and rely on what prisoner advocates say is inadequate health care. </p>
<p>
     Correctional officers, meanwhile, have complained about lack of access to masks and other protective gear, and that inmates are still being transferred between facilities despite fears about the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>
     Attorney General William Barr this month said he had asked the bureau to find ways to expand the use of home confinement for some sick and elderly inmates, but prisoner-rights groups questioned whether that would be sufficient to ease the cramped conditions. </p>

Coronavirus Deaths Top 30,000 as China Opens Up Province Where It Began</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Stella Yifan Xie </pre>
<p>
     China further eased restrictions that had locked down its economy Sunday, as fatalities from the coronavirus pandemic shot past 30,000 globally. </p>
<p>
     The death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the new virus quintupled over the past two weeks to 30,847 on Sunday, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed. </p>
<p>
     Deaths topped 10,000 in Italy and closed in on 700 in New York City, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     Japan logged 199 new cases Saturday--its biggest one-day jump--bringing its total coronavirus infections to 1,724. The latest death toll was 55. </p>
<p>
     Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday warned citizens to prepare for a &quot;long-term battle.&quot; He pledged his government would roll out a stimulus package exceeding the one passed during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. </p>
<p>
     As the epicenter of the pandemic has shifted to the West, Chinese officials have gradually eased the draconian restrictions in central Hubei province that have cut off the flow of goods and people for about two months. </p>
<p>
     The country&apos;s civil aviation regulator reopened domestic flights Sunday in Hubei after weeks of suspension. Flights remain suspended at the province&apos;s largest airport in Wuhan, the city where the world&apos;s first cases were reported late last year and the one worst-hit by China&apos;s Covid-19 outbreak. Flights to and from Wuhan&apos;s Tianhe International Airport will return to service starting April 8. </p>
<p>
     Local authorities in Hubei province, where the death toll is about 3,100, had removed all checkpoints on highways except for in the city of Wuhan as of Friday, said the official Xinhua News Agency. Wuhan&apos;s subway system also resumed operation over the weekend after a two-month suspension. </p>
<p>
     Nearly all of China&apos;s large supermarkets, convenience stores and shopping malls have reopened, Wang Bin, an official with China&apos;s Ministry of Commerce, said Saturday, adding that more than 80% of restaurants and 60% of hotels have resumed business. </p>
<p>
     Yet some major Chinese cities continued to tighten control over international arrivals to get a handle on cases imported from abroad, which could trigger a second wave of infection domestically. </p>
<p>
     The coastal trade hub of Shanghai began imposing 14-day quarantines at designated venues for all inbound travelers starting Saturday, while Guangzhou, another popular destination for international flights to China&apos;s manufacturing heartland, stepped up quarantine rules for arrivals over the weekend. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We must under no circumstances take the battle of epidemic control lightly, and a relaxed mood shall not come too soon,&quot; the official People&apos;s Daily newspaper wrote in a front-page editorial Sunday. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 45 new infections Saturday. Only one, in Henan province, was locally transmitted; the rest were imported from overseas, the commission said. </p>
<p>
     In the U.S., tensions escalated over the suggestion of quarantines. </p>
<p>
     President Trump backed down Saturday evening after earlier saying he might quarantine New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut following a backlash from state leaders. Instead, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a domestic travel advisory cautioning against visits to those areas. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo dismissed the idea of quarantine as a &quot;federal declaration of war on states&quot; and questioned the legal basis for such measures. Reported cases in New York City topped 30,000, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     The pandemic has taken a toll on the U.S. economy, as millions have lost jobs and the stock market has plunged. </p>
<p>
     The country added more than 19,000 infections by Sunday, pushing the total to over 124,000, as the number of confirmed coronavirus infections world-wide climbed above 665,000, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     Governments in Asia remain vigilant. Some announced plans to unleash stimulus packages to minimize the economic blow from the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday announced a $1.1 billion package to support health services including mental health and domestic violence. The country reported 431 new infections as of Sunday morning, taking its total number above 3,800. </p>
<p>
     New Zealand reported its first death linked to the coronavirus Sunday, while the number of new cases slowed to 63. </p>
<p>
     Singapore&apos;s immigration authority Sunday canceled a citizen&apos;s passport for defying stay-at-home rules. The country reported 70 new cases Saturday--its second highest one-day jump--bringing the total to more than 800. </p>

Coronavirus Threatens to Overwhelm Cities&apos; Social Safety Net</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Douglas Belkin and Kate King | Photographs by Sarah Blesener for The Wall Street Journal </pre>
<p>
     The economic shutdown caused by the coronavirus is testing America&apos;s safety net, and the people holding it aloft are feeling the strain. </p>
<p>
     In Seattle, among the first U.S. cities where the virus was detected, a flood of people have flocked to homeless shelters, slammed suicide hotlines and packed food pantries. People at the center of the rush say that the wave is only beginning to build and that already they are struggling to meet demand. </p>
<p>
     Calls to Crisis Connections, the Seattle area&apos;s hotlines for suicide, domestic abuse and substance abuse, have jumped 25% to about 25,000 a month since the virus was first reported, said Executive Director Allie Franklin. She said she worked two graveyard shifts in recent days because there weren&apos;t enough volunteers or staff to man the phones. </p>
<p>
     Many of the callers have never reached out for help, Ms. Franklin said. Some are isolated, unable to go to church or work or other community events and are feeling depressed. Those with addictions call to find out which treatment facilities or AA meetings are open. And laid-off workers with little savings are calling to ask where food banks are and how they work. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have people entering the social safety net who have never used it before,&quot; she said. &quot;What if this goes on for months?&quot; </p>
<p>
     The economic shutdown is hitting the poor and working class with the most force, especially in cities with growing income gaps and disproportionately high homeless populations. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I got my first unemployment check. Ever,&quot; said Heather Scott, a 43-year-old restaurant manager in Seattle who lost her job two weeks ago. The check will cover her rent and not much else. She has volunteered at a food bank for a decade and has been explaining to friends and co-workers how to use its services. </p>
<p>
     She believes she may soon follow her own advice. &quot;We all live paycheck to paycheck,&quot; she says of her peers. </p>
<p>
     Seattle has about 11,000 homeless people, of whom about 3,500 are sheltered, said Prof. Dennis Culhane, who studies homelessness at the University of Pennsylvania. Before the virus was first detected, Mary&apos;s Place, the city&apos;s largest system of homeless shelters, was largely filled to capacity, said Marty Hartman, director of the shelter. Now, 25 new families are showing up daily, she said. </p>
<p>
     In a typical week, 200 to 300 volunteers help run the shelters, which have 800 beds spread across 10 locations. But because of the coronavirus, no volunteers are coming, Mrs. Hartman said. The demand on the paid staff is greater than ever, with surfaces needing to be disinfected regularly and people needing to be screened for symptoms when they enter, she said. </p>
<p>
     Beds, which are usually 2 feet apart, now have to be spaced at least 6 feet apart to protect against the spreading of the virus. That means each facility can only accommodate about half as many people, leaving shelters scrambling for more room. </p>
<p>
     A thousand miles to the south, the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank reported a 20% uptick in demand over the past three weeks, Chief Executive Michael Flood said. He called the ramp-up far more dramatic than the recession that began in 2007, when business slowed and money was tight but the economy kept chugging along. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is like the train just stopped in the middle of the tracks,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s shaping up to be much worse than anything we&apos;ve seen.&quot; </p>
<p>
     To handle the influx, officials have set up drive-through food pantries where volunteers hand out bags of food. Mr. Flood said he is trying to work out a way to deliver food to the 28,000 senior citizens who rely on the food bank but have been ordered to shelter in place. </p>
<p>
     So far the food bank is well stocked, and community efforts have raised awareness and money, but he worries about the long-term effects if the pandemic lasts. </p>
<p>
     About 70,000 of the nation&apos;s 575,000 homeless population live in Los Angeles. The largest cohort are in their 50s, but their physical health is often more in line with people in their 70s, Prof. Culhane said. The virus will force them into hospitals at a rate two to three times higher than others their age if they contract it, he said. </p>
<p>
     To create enough shelter space, the nation needs 400,000 new beds, Prof Culhane said. </p>
<p>
     In New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio&apos;s administration was struggling to house a large homeless population before the pandemic, officials are now scrambling to reduce overcrowding and provide isolation housing for those who contract the virus. The city has about 500 isolation units available at four locations separate from homeless shelters. More than 100 people are currently living in these units, a spokesman for the Department of Social Services said. </p>
<p>
     Josh Dean, executive director of the advocacy group Human.nyc, said many places that offered the homeless use of their showers and restrooms, such as recreation centers and soup kitchens, have closed or are no longer offering those services to avoid spreading the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     &quot;People are on the streets and really struggling to find basic needs at a time when personal hygiene is so important,&quot; Mr. Dean said. </p>
<p>
     The city has issued an emergency procurement for additional drop-in center capacity and is asking not-for-profit groups to help. </p>
<p>
     Before the pandemic, Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen in New York City served about 1,000 hot meals buffet-style every weekday in the sanctuary of the 175-year-old Episcopal church. Now it is distributing bagged lunches and hot meals in the courtyard, Chief Operating Officer Michael Ottley said. </p>
<p>
     The soup kitchen suspended its volunteer program out of concerns for volunteers&apos; health and food donations are down, so the organization is relying on staff and purchasing some food. A few volunteers continue to show up and are allowed to work if they are healthy, Mr. Ottley said. On Wednesday, they prepared 800 meals and found themselves about 30 short, he said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The line was the longest I&apos;ve ever seen it,&quot; he said. </p>

This Trade Has Returned 633% in 2020 -- but Buyer Beware</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Gunjan Banerji and Mischa Frankl-Duval </pre>
<p>
     One of this year&apos;s hottest trades is betting on stock volatility. It is also one of the riskiest. </p>
<p>
     Traders big and small have sought to profit from the market&apos;s wild swings. They are doing so through derivatives and exchange-traded products that tend to profit when markets are shaky. Some of the investments promise heightened exposure to volatility and often gain in value when stocks fall and turbulence rises. </p>
<p>
     It is the latest iteration of a long-running obsession with trading volatility since the last financial crisis, when betting on the speed and severity of market moves started to take off among retail and institutional investors alike. </p>
<p>
     This month&apos;s moves have been unrivaled in the stock market&apos;s history, igniting even more interest in the trade. The S&amp;P 500 has swung an average of 5.2% every day, the highest on record and surpassing moves during the financial crisis, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p>
<p>
     The head-spinning stretch for markets includes the index&apos;s fastest-ever drop from a record into a bear market -- defined as a 20% fall from the peak. U.S. stocks logged their worst week since the financial crisis earlier this month, then proceeded last week to stage the biggest three-day rebound since the 1930s. </p>
<p>
     Many are expecting the gyrations to continue as investors better understand the depth of the downturn stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. In the coming week, investors will get fresh reads on manufacturing and consumer confidence. New data released Friday showed a measure of consumer sentiment dropped sharply in March. </p>
<p>
     The recent swings -- and perhaps the fear of the unknown ahead -- make volatility wagers more enticing. </p>
<p>
     Assets under management for one such product, the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Note, which goes by the ticker TVIX, hit a record $6.1 billion on March 19, FactSet data going back to 2014 show. Similarly, assets in the iPath Series B S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN, or VXX, hit at least a two-year high of $2.6 billion that day. This month, VXX has been among the most popular exchange-traded products in the entire U.S. stock market. </p>
<p>
     It is easy to see their allure. While stock markets around the world have plunged this year, volatility has soared to levels never seen. Through Friday, the products were up 633% and 235%, respectively, year to date. </p>
<p>
     The S&amp;P 500, meanwhile, has fallen 21% over that period. Its sharp swings continued last week even as the index leapt 10% higher after a month of punishing declines. </p>
<p>
     Through this tumult, even traditionally safer investments like gold and government bonds have fallen at times alongside stocks. </p>
<p>
     As other assets have fallen, rising volatility has drawn investors who might not otherwise trade the products, says Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments. </p>
<p>
     &quot;When things start to calm down, the vol can move fast and come out of the market quicker than anything else,&quot; Mr. Taylor said. &quot;People trading the vol ETNs and ETFs right now, I think, have to be really careful because those gains can drop quite quickly,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     The products are notoriously risky to bet on. In the past, critics have said the products can sow more havoc and create distortions in markets. Holding them can chip away at a portfolio&apos;s returns and timing their moves to profit from big jumps in volatility can be tricky even for seasoned traders. </p>
<p>
     Among those drawn to the trade is Shweta Agrawal, a retail trader based in Dayton, Ohio. She initially was attracted to TVIX because it appeared to buck the trend of the rest of the market. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It looked like it was going against the market. Everything was going down, and TVIX was going up,&quot; Ms. Agrawal said. </p>
<p>
     But in an unusual move, TVIX recently has fallen even as U.S. stocks plunged. For example, the product fell 6% March 20 as the S&amp;P 500 dropped 4.3%. Something similar happened Monday. As TVIX kept falling in value, Ms. Agrawal kept buying, sure that it would rebound. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Agrawal said she lost about $50,000 trading the volatility product, a sizable portion of her portfolio. &quot;I should have cut my losses,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Credit Suisse Group AG states in disclosures for the TVIX product that its volatility products are meant for sophisticated investors and should be used for short-term trading. Buying and holding the product likely will lead to significant losses, and the long-term value of the product is &quot;zero,&quot; the firm says. </p>
<p>
     Joe Amaturo, a Warwick, N.Y.-based project manager, said he initially bought shares of TVIX earlier in the year as he grew wary of the epic run in U.S. stocks, which were trading at records. It had been a drag on his portfolio, until recently. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I added more because we are going into a big downturn in our economic situation,&quot; Mr. Amaturo said. &quot;Panic is hitting the market.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Amaturo said his small stake won him a few thousand dollars, which he plans to save in case he needs extra cash during the coronavirus slowdown. And despite the gains, the swings have been tough to stomach. &quot;It is an emotional roller-coaster when you do own it. You worry: is it going to be up tomorrow, or is it going to be down?&quot; Mr. Amaturo said. </p>
<p>
     The product, for example, jumped 40% March 18, only to fall 20% the next day. </p>
<p>
     If volatility edges lower, that could lure traders back into the popular short-volatility trade to profit from calming markets, which can be equally treacherous. For example, one popular short-volatility product gained 6.2% over the past week as traders piled into it, while a long-volatility wager dropped 16%. </p>
<p>
     In a now-infamous episode from February 2018, which came to be known as &quot; Volmageddon,&quot; exchange-traded products that had executed the popular short-volatility trade collapsed as a bout of turbulence hit markets. Many said their big unwind exacerbated volatility. </p>
<p>
     Issuers of such exchange-traded products aim to ensure their returns track the performance of underlying indexes. The larger the product and more extreme the market moves, the bigger those trades can be -- and the greater their potential impact. </p>
<p>
     Some have to &quot;buy more exposure on an up day or sell more exposure on a down day,&quot; said Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research at FactSet, referring to geared products that seek to magnify returns. &quot;An end-of-the-day buyer pushes a market further up, and an end-of-the-day seller pushes the market further down.&quot; </p>

Coronavirus Pandemic Compels Historic Labor Shift</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Ruth Bender and Matthew Dalton </pre>
<p>
     The coronavirus pandemic is forcing the fastest reallocation of labor since World War II, with companies and governments mobilizing an army of idled workers into new activities that are urgently needed. </p>
<p>
     Around the world, former hotel, restaurant and airline staff are moving to grocers, online retailers and hospitals as parts of the economy are shuttered to prevent the spread of the disease--and essential goods and services are strained. </p>
<p>
     The shifts also include some governments urging furloughed workers and students to join in planting and picking fruit and vegetables. Meanwhile in Germany, McDonald&apos;s Corp. is lending staff to two big grocery chains desperate for workers. </p>
<p>
     Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup North America, a staffing company, said the workforce shifts were shaping up to be the largest her company had seen since it was founded in 1948. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Tens of thousands of jobs open up overnight,&quot; she said. &quot;We have to move within hours.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In the U.S., the pool of potential workers has exploded. A record 3.28 million people applied for unemployment benefits, the government reported last week. Though at the same time, big companies that have seen pandemic-fueled spikes in demand, including Walmart Inc. and CVS Health Corp, are seeking nearly 500,000 new staff members in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>
     In Europe--where social safety nets mean fewer workers have lost their jobs--governments are trying to move workers to where they are most needed. </p>
<p>
     Germany last weekpassed laws to give incentives to people put on Kurzarbeit--a government program where unneeded workers stay home on about two-thirds of their pay--to take up side jobs in industries like health care and farming. Malte Voigts, who runs a farm in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, has been slammed with phone calls from locals wanting to help in the fields. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There were cooks, waiters, music teachers, physiotherapists, scaffold builders and sales managers,&quot; said Mr. Voigts, who usually employs 150 to 170 seasonal workers from Poland and Romania, now blocked due to border closures. &quot;I was completely taken aback.&quot; </p>
<p>
     French Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume said last week that the country&apos;s farms need 45,000 workers in March, 80,000 on top of that in April, and another 80,000 in May, as foreign seasonal workers can&apos;t come this year. </p>
<p>
     Economists don&apos;t expect the sector hiring booms to offset the millions of job losses forecast in the months to come. Many of the job shifts will prove temporary. Still, for some, it is forcing a re-evaluation of the notion of a safe, future-proof job by revealing which sectors are genuinely essential. </p>
<p>
     After losing her job at a company that processes payroll for the restaurant industry earlier this month, Shae Wall, a 37-year-old in Oklahoma City, is looking for a new career in health care.  It&apos;s &quot;virus proof,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     The labor reallocation manifests itself in big and small ways. Jason Kirsch, who operates the Corner Market &amp; Pharmacy, outside Washington, recently hired four out-of-work restaurant workers and a bartender to restock shelves and help with other tasks. He has received about two dozen applications. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I can literally have someone come in in the morning and have them working by the afternoon,&quot; said Mr. Kirsch. </p>
<p>
     Marks &amp; Spencer PLC, a British clothing and grocery chain, has moved more than 4,600 staff from its in-store cafes and clothing department to its grocery business. The company is trying to match workers to similar jobs. </p>
<p>
     The German chiefs of Aldi Nord and Aldi S&#252;d, two family-owned discount grocery chains, and McDonald&apos;s quickly realized they could all gain by sharing employees. One after the other this month, German states were ordering restaurants to shut. The two grocery chains, on the other hand, have been competing with other food retailers to hire thousands of temporary helpers. </p>
<p>
     The companies negotiated a pact in a few days, according to a McDonald&apos;s spokeswoman. McDonald&apos;s employees were allowed to switch to short-term contracts at the chains. Most contracts run for an initial two months, with an option for workers to return to their McDonald&apos;s jobs once the crisis is over. </p>
<p>
     The chains told McDonald&apos;s they needed 3,000 workers. McDonald&apos;s employees bring transferable skills, so training is minimal. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Exceptional times require exceptional solutions,&quot; said Nicol&#225;s de Lope, spokesman for the board of Aldi Nord. </p>
<p>
     The worker sharing echoes similar moves taken in China&apos;s state-controlled economy earlier in the crisis. When the virus prompted shutdowns of Chinese cities, fast-food chains, restaurants and other leisure companies lent staff to e-commerce businesses facing spiking demand for home deliveries, according to Fang Ruan, partner at Boston Consulting Group, who advises Chinese companies on personnel issues. That allowed companies to avoid big layoffs, while allowing them to restaff quickly once demand picks up again. </p>
<p>
     Temporary-work agencies have become a key driver behind the effort to reallocate workers. French agency Mistertemp&apos; group is currently moving thousands of workers who used to work in car plants, construction or the event industry into roles as packers, logistics-center forklift drivers or cashiers. Cross-sector shifts make up about a third of the jobs the agency is currently working to fill, mostly in food and online retailing, said Chief Marketing Officer Jean-Loup Wirotius. </p>
<p>
     Souber Abdoullahi Nour, a 22 year-old business student from the French city of Rennes, lost his temp job at a Peugeot factory. Now, he prepares orders in a retail warehouse. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are getting more orders than we can deliver,&quot; he said. &quot;So, I feel I will have work for some time.&quot; </p>

Activists Lay Down Their Arms as Companies Cope With Coronavirus Spread</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Corrie Driebusch </pre>
<p>
     Being a shareholder activist investor isn&apos;t such a good look right now. </p>
<p>
     Executives are struggling to keep their companies afloat and their workers employed as the coronavirus spreads, and activists&apos; demands in many cases seem less pertinent than they did just a few weeks ago. That&apos;s led many of the investors to walk away from campaigns or settle them early. </p>
<p>
     Last week, Carl Icahn agreed to end his campaign to oust the entire board of beleaguered oil company Occidental Petroleum Corp., settling instead for two seats and a say in choosing a third. Starboard Value LP reached a settlement with Box Inc. that will put three independent directors on the cloud-software company&apos;s board. </p>
<p>
     Elliott Management Corp. recently ended its opposition to Capgemini SE&apos;s bid for Altran Technologies SA, saying in a regulatory filing it&apos;s willing to sell its Altran shares to the French consulting firm. </p>
<p>
     Elliott -- like Mr. Icahn and Starboard, one of the most feared activists in corporate America -- is seeing more opportunities for behind-the-scenes, &quot;constructive&quot; ways to work with companies, a person familiar with the matter said. That could mean helping shore up their finances by buying up the companies&apos; beaten-down bonds or equity. </p>
<p>
     The shift comes at a normally busy time for activists, known as proxy season, when they have the opportunity to nominate directors ahead of annual meetings that tend to take place in the spring. </p>
<p>
     This year, however, it falls as companies are focused on keeping employees safe and making payroll as revenue dissipates. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Companies right now are struggling to keep workforces together,&quot; said Edward McCarthy of D.F. King &amp; Co., who canvasses shareholders to gather votes in proxy contests. &quot;To take away from that is just bad for everyone.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Activist hedge funds, for their part, are struggling with the whipsawing stock market. An index of their performance tracked by data group HFR was down by about 11% through the end of February, the most up-to-date information available. A greater drop could be coming in March, as the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 14%. </p>
<p>
     Some activists with concentrated portfolios are under even more pressure. Mantle Ridge LP, run by a former lieutenant of William Ackman who tends to hold positions for many years, has been buffeted by a steep decline in shares of Aramark Corp. Mantle Ridge owns a roughly 18% stake in the food-service giant, whose shares have fallen by more than 50% this year as schools and other institutions across the country shut down. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Any single major bet is a bold move,&quot; said Bill Anderson of Evercore Inc., one of the top activism-defense bankers. &quot;And for the short term, any bold move can be scary.&quot; </p>
<p>
     While this proxy season may be quieter than usual, it could give way to a busy period for corporate raiders should share prices remain low and the challenges companies now face linger. </p>
<p>
     Not all activists are retiring from the battlefield. Some privately argue that in a crisis it matters even more to have good managers, making it necessary in certain situations to press on. </p>
<p>
     Starboard, led by Chief Executive Jeff Smith, recently published a letter to eBay Inc.&apos;s board confirming an earlier Wall Street Journal report that it has nominated directors to the board of the online marketplace and urging it to search for an external CEO. Starboard acknowledged the unique period the world is in, with Peter Feld, managing member of the company, signing the letter &quot;Best regards and stay healthy.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In its response, eBay said it was disappointed that Starboard decided to announce its nominations &quot;amidst the global Covid-19 pandemic while the board and management are trying to focus on the business, employee health and safety, and the important CEO search and portfolio review that are under way.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;With the volatility and the virus, it&apos;s going to be slower this spring, sure, but that doesn&apos;t mean 2020 is a washout,&quot; said Bruce Goldfarb, head of Okapi Partners LLC, a proxy-solicitation firm that helps activists and companies communicate with shareholders. </p>
<p>
     Either way, many companies are taking no chances. Some are seeking standstill agreements with activists or settlements that they might not otherwise have agreed to, advisers say. Others are attempting to delay their annual meetings. </p>
<p>
     Still others, fearful that rivals or activists may take advantage of their beaten-down stock prices to take big stakes they can use to wield influence, are rushing to adopt so-called poison pills, with implementation of the defense tool lately spiking to a rate unseen in years. </p>

Manufacturers Seek U.S. Help in Deciding Where to Ship Scarce Medical Goods</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus and Andrew Restuccia </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- Producers and distributors of medical supplies across the country are raising red flags about what they say is a lack of guidance from the federal government about where to send their products, as hospitals compete for desperately needed masks and ventilators to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Company executives say they are ill-equipped to make decisions about which hospitals and states should first receive their medical supplies and are calling on the government to step in. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s really the allocation piece that&apos;s most important to us right now because we just cannot and never will have a window into what the most urgent need is,&quot; said Scott Whitaker, chief executive of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade association that represents producers of medical devices. </p>
<p>
     Charlie Mills, chief executive of Medline Industries Inc., a large privately held manufacturer and distributor of medical supplies, said as the company works to ramp up its production of supplies, it is being inundated with orders. He said he would welcome the government having a &quot;strong say&quot; in how to respond. </p>
<p>
     &quot;All of our customers are wanting more,&quot; Mr. Mills said. &quot;The federal government might be in a better position to decide where it would go.&quot; </p>
<p>
     So far, the Trump administration hasn&apos;t provided the companies with formal guidance about where to distribute their products, leaving them to make such decisions on their own. Hundreds of companies last week sent a breakdown of their inventories of masks, ventilators and other medical supplies to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, and have been waiting for the agency to advise them on which areas are most urgently in need of supplies. </p>
<p>
     The White House referred a request for comment to FEMA. A spokeswoman for FEMA declined to give a timeline for when the agency would provide allocation guidance to companies. &quot;We have been able to make connections with multiple companies, but due to the large volume of response, the task force is still reading through the offers,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Hospitals across the U.S. are running out of the masks, gowns, ventilators and other equipment they need to treat patients diagnosed with coronavirus and protect staff, say hospital officials, doctors and others in the industry. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week the state needs at least 30,000 ventilators. The Trump administration has prepared a protocol for how to split ventilators among multiple Covid-19 patients, according to two doctors working on it. </p>
<p>
     The administration has faced criticism in recent weeks from governors and health-care workers for its reluctance to make full use of the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that allows the president both to order companies to prioritize the production of certain goods and to control where those goods are distributed. </p>
<p>
     Governors have called on Mr. Trump to invoke the law to ensure not just production, but also the efficient distribution of scarce supplies to areas most in need, and to keep states from competing against each other for lifesaving equipment. </p>
<p>
     Producers and distributors of those supplies say that in the absence of guidance from the federal government, they have continued to send their regular shipments of medical supplies, without knowing whether those supplies are more urgently needed elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     The administration has broad authority to direct the allocation of such supplies. It could invoke the Defense Production Act to do so -- but some companies say the law isn&apos;t needed. They are prepared to follow the government&apos;s guidelines without the law&apos;s mandates, but so far such guidance has been scarce. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, Mr. Trump for the first time during this pandemic invoked the DPA to order General Motors Co. to sharply ramp up the production of ventilators to treat coronavirus patients, saying GM was &quot;wasting time&quot; in negotiations. GM said it already was moving to make the machines as soon as possible. The president also appointed trade adviser Peter Navarro to oversee the government&apos;s role in directing private-sector help in fighting the virus. </p>
<p>
     But the president&apos;s order to GM on Friday focused on production, not distribution. Earlier in the week, the Trump administration announced that Rear Adm. John Polowczyk would head up a supply-chain task force at FEMA intended to bolster the supply of medical equipment. He said the agency was working with companies to &quot;make better allocation decisions and understand where it is and where it needs to go.&quot; </p>
<p>
     FEMA officials told congressional committees in a telephone briefing on Wednesday that they had sought the data from distributors of medical supplies but suggested they lacked total control over whether to invoke the DPA to issue prioritization guidance to companies, saying the White House task force on coronavirus was involved in those decisions, according to a congressional aide. </p>
<p>
     On the call, administration officials said the White House had opted not to invoke the Defense Production Act to acquire and direct the distribution of supplies and equipment to certain areas because it hadn&apos;t found the need, echoing remarks by the president in recent days. When officials were asked what the administration viewed as the threshold for invoking the law, they were unable to answer, the aide said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Trump Administration&apos;s refusal to use all the tools at its disposal to get critical supplies to frontline medical workers is its latest failure to address this public health and economic crisis,&quot; said Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. </p>
<p>
     In a letter to FEMA administrator Peter Gaynor on Thursday, the head of the Health Industry Distributors Association asked the federal government to designate specific ZIP Codes, jurisdictions or care facilities as priorities to receive medical supplies. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I am writing to urge FEMA to provide the strategic direction needed to more effectively target PPE supplies based on greatest need,&quot; wrote Matthew Rowan, the association&apos;s president and CEO, referring to personal protective equipment. &quot;The private sector is not in a position to make these judgments. Only the federal government has the data and the authority to provide this strategic direction to the supply chain and the healthcare system.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;We understand prioritization is on your agenda,&quot; he added, &quot;but urge you to expedite the work.&quot; </p>
<p>
     FEMA last weekend sent a spreadsheet to producers and distributors, asking them to identify their inventory of more than two dozen types of personal protective equipment -- including N-95 masks, gloves, protective eyewear and hand sanitizer -- as well as of ventilators, inhalers, tubing sets and Food and Drug Administration-approved testing materials. Among the information FEMA sought about the companies&apos; inventory was its current location and the destination of its planned shipments. </p>
<p>
     Company executives said they didn&apos;t fault the federal government for not yet providing guidance on allocation, adding that they expected clarity soon. They said administration officials have been communicative and responsive to their concerns. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The administration has been tremendous to work with on this,&quot; Mr. Whitaker, of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, said, &quot;and I think every company would echo that.&quot; </p>

U.S. Rebuffs Calls to Close Stock Market</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Alexander Osipovich </pre>
<p>
     The Trump administration has vowed to keep the stock market open, even as the coronavirus pandemic and a steep selloff have led some commentators and politicians to suggest a temporary closure could soothe frightened investors. </p>
<p>
     The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 25% since mid-February, the fastest decline from a record to a bear market in history. The volatility has also been unprecedented: The index has swung 5.2% on average each day in March, on course to top the previous record of 3.9% from November 1929. Even after the stock market&apos;s remarkable three-day rally last week, many investors are still anxious as the U.S. death toll climbs and many states are in lockdown. </p>
<p>
     Despite the severity of the selloff, officials have said the market has functioned well. Closing stock markets could trigger a cascading series of consequences that would ultimately harm investors, financial executives and academics say. </p>
<p>
     With the stock market closed, investors would be unable to sell securities in their brokerage or retirement accounts, forcing them to sell other assets if they needed cash -- and potentially fueling disastrous runs on banks and other markets such as bonds. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We think it is in the best interest to keep the markets open,&quot; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a Thursday meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a body of regulators that includes the heads of the Treasury, Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>
     Representatives from the New York Stock Exchange, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., and Nasdaq Inc. have also said they are committed to keeping their exchanges open. </p>
<p>
     Proponents of closing the market say it could help investors catch their breath while they are coping with the coronavirus pandemic. &quot;Maybe close a day or two...Calm the waters, if you will,&quot; Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) told MSNBC television on March 19. </p>
<p>
     Some in the financial industry agree. Executives from some of the world&apos;s largest asset managers told the Bank of England&apos;s new governor in a conference call earlier this month that financial markets should close for two weeks, although a majority of those on the call disagreed. It couldn&apos;t be learned which executives wanted to close the markets. </p>
<p>
     Closing the stock market has precedent. In 1914, the NYSE closed for about four months when World War I broke out in Europe, partly because of pressure from President Woodrow Wilson&apos;s administration. Stock exchanges also closed for more than a week in March 1933 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a bank holiday to stop a financial panic. </p>
<p>
     In comparison with 1914 or 1933, a far greater share of the U.S. population owns stocks, which means many more households would be affected. </p>
<p>
     Some on Wall Street fear that even mentioning the idea of closing the exchanges could spark a selloff. On Oct. 19, 1987 -- the day of the &quot;Black Monday&quot; market crash -- then-SEC chairman David Ruder told reporters that trading might be halted. It wasn&apos;t, but some exchange officials said his remark may have added to the panic. Mr. Ruder, who died last month at age 90, later said the comment had been a mistake. </p>
<p>
     &quot;You could actually be causing more chaos by trying to close the U.S. markets down,&quot; Terrence Duffy, chairman and chief executive of futures-exchange operator CME Group Inc., told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. &quot;I think it&apos;s a horrible idea.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Regulators have broad authority to suspend trading in case of a market emergency. The SEC can suspend trading on U.S. stock exchanges for up to 90 days, provided it notifies President Trump and he doesn&apos;t object. </p>
<p>
     If exchanges had to close, it would be a relatively simple process -- effectively flipping a switch. The overwhelming majority of trading in stocks, options and futures is electronic. </p>
<p>
     This means that as the NYSE and other exchanges have closed their floors in recent weeks due to coronavirus, trading has continued with few noticeable effects. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The markets are functioning well,&quot; said Tal Cohen, head of North American markets at Nasdaq. &quot;The direction of stock prices is another question.&quot; </p>

Coronavirus Divides Restaurants Into Those With or Without Drive-Throughs</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Heather Haddon </pre>
<p>
     The drive-through, a nearly 90-year-old American invention, may be fast-food restaurants&apos; best shot at surviving the coronavirus lockdown. </p>
<p>
     Even those companies that have the drive-through option say they will still likely endure hundreds of millions of dollars in sales losses in the coming months after officials across the country have banned dine-in eating to try to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Yet drive-through is one of the few ways to reach customers in nearly every U.S. state, along with carryout and delivery. Big chains such as McDonald&apos;s Corp., Restaurant Brands International Inc.&apos;s Burger King and Yum Brands Inc.&apos;s KFC that already make up to 70% of sales at the drive-through are better positioned to weather the crisis. </p>
<p>
     Customers can order food in a drive-through without coming into close contact with a server or entering a dining room, minimizing exposure to the virus. </p>
<p>
     Matt Harris, a 33-year-old assistant professor from Kansas City, Mo., said drive-through seems like one of the safest options to get food right now. He has noticed the lines of cars pulling up to drive-through chains in his area has lightened, but they are far busier than the local Olive Garden and Red Lobster. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The lack of traffic feels almost post-apocalyptic,&quot; Mr. Harris said. </p>
<p>
     Some companies with drive-throughs are retooling their operations as they shift nearly all of their business there. </p>
<p>
     Drive-throughs now account for around 90% of U.S. sales at Wendy&apos;s Co., compared with about two-thirds before the pandemic. The Dublin, Ohio-based chain is redirecting the cash it had planned to use for a new national breakfast offering to franchisees and promotions for drive-through and delivery instead. </p>
<p>
     Some franchisees of restaurant chains with drive-throughs are slapping up signs, and companies are sending out tweets to let skittish customers know they are open for business and safe to patronize. They are trying to maintain drive-through service times while having crews practice social distancing. Yum Brands&apos; Taco Bell is featuring its drive-through workers in promotional campaigns. </p>
<p>
     The basics of the drive-through are largely unchanged from their early 20th-century origins in the U.S. But some of the bigger chains, including McDonald&apos;s and Burger King, have each spent tens of millions of dollars in recent years to equip their drive-throughs with digital menu boards because many consumers still prefer ordering from their cars to dining in or the newer phenomenon of delivery. </p>
<p>
     McDonald&apos;s, in a television ad that made its debut last week, said: &quot;We&apos;ll be taking your order in the drive-through.... Just like we have for the last 65 years, we can still be here to take your order.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Fast-food-delivery sales are growing but are still small compared with the amount customers spend on carryout and drive-through, which are more familiar to many diners and don&apos;t come with added fees. Consumers spent $83 billion in drive-throughs in the year through February, compared to less than $20 billion for restaurant delivery, according to industry-firm the NPD Group. </p>
<p>
     McDonald&apos;s, which introduced its first drive-through in Arizona in 1975, was already making around 70% of its sales in the U.S. to customers ordering from their cars before the coronavirus crisis erupted. In the past year it has tried to cut drive-through times via investments such as speed-of-service timers and by paring down its menu. Now, the company is temporarily removing items from its menus and suspending all-day breakfast to further simplify operations. </p>
<p>
     Even at the drive-through, business is weaker as consumers stay home. Franchisees for McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen units of Restaurant Brands International Inc., KFC and Taco Bell said their customer traffic was 10% to 30% lower in the past week. Many owners said they were closing stores early and reducing staff hours because of sales declines. </p>
<p>
     McDonald&apos;s increased its cash balance to $4.5 billion after borrowing another $1 billion earlier this week, and Yum Brands, also the parent company of Pizza Hut, drew down $525 million from its credit line. Yum said it expects the virus to depress its same-store sales by the mid- toGo high-single digits in its current quarter, and more so in the next period. </p>
<p>
     &quot;No one is going to make money at this time,&quot; said David Barr, owner of 30 KFC and Taco Bell locations across three southeastern states. </p>
<p>
     Restaurants without drive-throughs, particularly casual-dining chains, face the most serious threat to their existence. </p>
<p>
     Some dine-in chains, such as Texas Roadhouse Inc., are setting up improvised drive-throughs to try to keep up some business. Others, including Olive Garden-owner Darden Restaurants Inc. and Applebee&apos;s parent-company Dine Brands Global Inc., are drawing down on credit lines, while casual-dining chains Cheesecake Factory Inc. and J. Alexander&apos;s Holdings Inc. have furloughed thousands of workers because of plunging dine-in traffic since the virus hit. </p>
<p>
     Ed Doherty, owner of 150 restaurants that include Applebee&apos;s and Panera locations, said sales plummeted at his New Jersey and New York restaurants by around 85% after the dine-in bans rolled out. Little of his sales before the coronavirus came from takeout. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There was absolutely no sales,&quot; said Mr. Doherty, who said he has laid off 5,000 of his 8,000 employees and likely will shed more. </p>

Doctors With Coronavirus Frightened by Their Own Symptoms</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Janet Adamy </pre>
<p>
     Days after caring for a handful of suspected coronavirus patients in mid-March, Dr. Gaurav Malhotra said he was struggling to breathe just from climbing one flight of stairs. Feverish night sweats soaked his clothes. </p>
<p>
     The 40-year old hospitalist at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., knew he&apos;d contracted Covid-19. </p>
<p>
     So he sat his wife down to make sure their will was in order. Then he turned to managing his case from their bedroom. With no access to intravenous fluids, he downed bottles of Gatorade. He demurred when his boss asked if he should come to the hospital, in part because he didn&apos;t want to expose his co-workers. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Part of our job is to deal with death on a daily basis,&quot; said Dr. Malhotra, who tested positive for the virus earlier this month. &quot;Now it was me doing it about myself.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Dr. Malhotra is among the growing number of clinicians nationwide who suspect they contracted the virus on the job. They are grappling with such issues as the lack of protective gear, how they could have avoided the virus when treating patients and how to get treated themselves. And like the rest of the public, they are frustrated by the testing process. </p>
<p>
     Northwell Health, his hospital&apos;s parent company, has 40 doctors who have tested positive for the virus at its 19 hospitals, spokesman Terry Lynam said. The company is &quot;doing as best we can&quot; to keep workers safe and has an adequate supply of protective equipment, he said, though workers are being asked to reuse N95 masks </p>
<p>
     Shortages of masks, surgical gowns, face shields and other crucial equipment are heightening medical workers&apos; concerns that they can&apos;t protect themselves from it. </p>
<p>
     Some worry that the virus is difficult to avoid once waiting rooms and hallways become crowded with patients carrying it. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I got infected even wearing all of my protective equipment,&quot; said Shelley Urquhart, a pulmonary and critical-care nurse practitioner at Norton Audubon Hospital in Louisville, Ky., who tested positive for the virus last week. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Urquhart, 36, and three doctors all noticed they had symptoms of the virus after treating one of her hospital&apos;s first Covid-19 patients for respiratory failure, she said. Holed up in her bedroom, she trades text messages with the sick clinicians about how they are managing fevers, sore throats, chest tightness and gastrointestinal distress. They have griped about how it took at least a week to get test results, which showed three of them had confirmed cases, she said. </p>
<p>
     A Norton Healthcare spokeswoman said it has robust prevention and screening initiatives to protect patients and employees from the spread of the disease, including frequent handwashing and proper use of protective equipment. </p>
<p>
     Across the U.S., some of the sickest doctors are using their own coronavirus cases to plead for access to experimental drugs from their hospital beds. Yisachar Greenberg, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, wrote on Twitter earlier this month that he&apos;d received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, but that his condition was worsening. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I am desperate can anyone help me get the drug from Gilead Remdesivir please help,&quot; read one of his tweets. Gilead Sciences Inc. has said it would begin late-stage studies this month for remdesivir, which has been identified as a possible treatment. A Gilead spokesperson said the company doesn&apos;t discuss individual cases. Maimonides Medical Center didn&apos;t comment on the situation. </p>
<p>
     Some doctors with less serious, though still severe, cases say they are reluctant to take up a bed in their hospital since they can rely on their own skills. </p>
<p>
     One Central Massachusetts interventional cardiologist who tested positive for the virus earlier this month said he is managing his severe case from a mattress on the floor of his home office. To make sure his oxygen doesn&apos;t dip dangerously low, he attached a finger monitor that his wife bought at Walgreens. At night he gets overcome with eerie febrile hallucinations where he hears a nurse call him to see a patient. But the only patient in the room is him, said the doctor. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Malhotra said the severity of his illness scared him. </p>
<p>
     A CrossFit devotee with no underlying medical conditions, he came home from a night shift earlier this month and sensed his temperature was rising. The next night he was sweating. He sent his wife to load up on Gatorade and went to his hospital for a coronavirus test at their employee testing area, which offered a quick turnaround. </p>
<p>
     Two days later, the results came back negative. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There&apos;s no way I don&apos;t have this thing,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;I&apos;ve never felt this bad before.&quot; So he went back for a second test, and that came back positive for Covid-19. </p>
<p>
     A friend who is an infectious-disease specialist offered to call in prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, two drugs that are being tested to treat the virus. Dr. Malhotra, who trained as an internal medicine physician, said no. </p>
<p>
     He didn&apos;t want to use up drugs that could go to sicker patients, and he worried that their side effects carried their own risks. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Malhotra said he wore an N95 mask and surgical gown while giving suspected coronavirus patients intravenous antibiotics and oxygen. At least one of them tested positive for Covid-19, he said. If those patients didn&apos;t give it to him, he suspects that he picked it up elsewhere at work. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It wasn&apos;t like I was walking around in the hospital gowned up 24-7,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s tough for health-care workers to avoid it because it&apos;s staying in the environment.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Dr. Malhotra said he hasn&apos;t seen his own primary-care doctor in four years and is instead leaning on his boss to monitor his symptoms -- which recently have grown less severe -- by text message. He took Tylenol and Motrin at least twice a day. He&apos;s also taking electrolyte tablets that his wife consumes when she runs marathons. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Other than turning toward my own friends and colleagues, I wouldn&apos;t know who to turn to in this situation,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     When he first came down with the virus, Dr. Malhotra said his children disinfected the door handles. But once his wife and daughter developed mild symptoms, that stopped. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, their suspicions were confirmed when his wife&apos;s test results showed she also has the virus. When Dr. Malhotra called the urgent-care clinic for his daughter&apos;s results, they said her test order had been canceled. The clinic offered no explanation, he said, just an apology. </p>

Dr. Fauci Was a Basketball Captain. Now He&apos;s America&apos;s Point Guard.</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Ben Cohen </pre>
<p>
     The basketball team at Regis High School had a 1-16 record as the players entered a rival&apos;s gym in the winter of 1958 fully expecting to leave with yet another loss. The other team&apos;s star was a future NBA coach who would one day run the New York Knicks. Regis was led by a diminutive future doctor who would one day run the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Nobody gave us a chance,&quot; said John Zeman, a Regis alumnus. &quot;Everyone figured it was going to be a blowout.&quot; </p>
<p>
     But there was one teenager who looked at this demoralizing collection of data and came to a wildly optimistic conclusion. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Tony said no,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re going to win this game. And we did.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Tony, the team captain better known as Fauch, a short kid with a thick Brooklyn accent who led his overmatched team to a highly improbable victory in the biggest game of his life, now answers to a name that most Americans have come to recognize: Dr. Anthony Fauci. </p>
<p>
     The infectious disease specialist who has long been regarded as a national treasure has become a source of trust for hundreds of millions of people over the last month. He is the raspy voice of reason. Fauci&apos;s deep expertise, avuncular demeanor and direct style of communication have turned a distinguished 79-year-old immunologist into the world&apos;s unlikeliest celebrity. </p>
<p>
     As the point guard of the U.S. response to public health scares, Fauci understands that crisis reveals character. But so does high-school basketball. The way that a bunch of teenagers come together as a team at such a formative time can be a powerful force that shapes the rest of their lives. And one win can stick with you forever. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I don&apos;t know how he could forget it,&quot; said Bob Bastek, his Regis classmate. </p>
<p>
     Fauci, who keeps a miniature basketball hoop in his office, has been called &quot;my hero&quot; by Bob Cousy and &quot;the GOAT&quot; by Stephen Curry for his role in this pandemic, which would have delighted a child who grew up playing sports and worshiping Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and Duke Snyder. When he earned a scholarship to Regis, an elite Jesuit school in New York for boys with academic and leadership potential, the free tuition was worth the fantastic schlep: a bus in Brooklyn to a local train to the express train to the IRT to the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He learned to finish his Latin and Greek homework on the commute to get a few hours of sleep at night. &quot;Basketball was important, &quot; said Jim Higney, the team manager. &quot;Homework was more important.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Fauci always knew he wanted to be a doctor. &quot;My interest in medicine stems from my keen interest in people, in asking questions and solving problems,&quot; he said in 1989 for a National Institutes of Health oral history. But there was another way for him to scratch that itch before medical school: basketball. </p>
<p>
     When he learned that Fauci was the captain of his basketball team, his former colleague Mike Goldrich once replied: &quot;Tony, how could you possibly be the captain of a basketball team?&quot; But he also knows that some people are smaller than their heights. Fauci was always bigger. </p>
<p>
     Here&apos;s the scouting report on Fauci: classic point guard, excellent ballhandler, pesky defender. Six of his classmates and teammates described him as a tenacious competitor in short shorts and striped socks whose feistiness on the court defied some parts of his personality and reflected others. </p>
<p>
     &quot;He was ready to drive through whoever was in his way,&quot; said Bob Burns. </p>
<p>
     &quot;He was just a ball of fire,&quot; Zeman said. &quot;He would literally dribble through a brick wall.&quot; </p>
<p>
     There is no evidence of Tony Fauci literally running through a brick wall. But the Regis gym was brick-lined until his junior year. By the time he was a senior, Fauci was a natural choice for team captain. </p>
<p>
     He also happened to be one of Regis&apos;s best players. Fauci was the outside threat, and his pal Artie Guarino was the inside force. &quot;It was like Mutt and Jeff with Guarino and Fauci,&quot; said George Garces, one of the school&apos;s three cheerleaders. </p>
<p>
     Fauci scored 10.2 points per game, according to the school yearbook, but his teammates say those stats were deceptive. The team would have fallen apart without him. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The leader doesn&apos;t always score the most points,&quot; Zeman said. &quot;He was the leader.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;He wasn&apos;t a yeller, and he wasn&apos;t a rah-rah-rah guy, but everybody looked up to him,&quot; said Tom McCorry, a classmate and future college-basketball coach. &quot;He worked hard and he was very unselfish -- kind of the way he shows now. He really is the same person.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Regis&apos;s players needed his leadership as they crammed into a subway car on the way to a rival school in the Bronx one afternoon. They also could have used talent. </p>
<p>
     It had been a lousy season. They had only won one game. Fordham Prep had come to Regis a few weeks earlier and won by 16 points. And there was no reason to believe this night would be any different. </p>
<p>
     The exact details of what happened in this one magical game have been forgotten to history. But the game itself was unforgettable because of the final score: Regis 64, Fordham Prep 51. </p>
<p>
     Regis&apos;s players didn&apos;t know how to react to this strange phenomenon otherwise known as winning a basketball game. They ran to the locker room to celebrate before realizing they were being called back to the floor to collect a trophy that Fordham Prep figured would be staying at Fordham Prep. &quot;I remember that game like yesterday,&quot; Zeman said. </p>
<p>
     The upset was such a seminal event that Fauci&apos;s teammates believe it must have left a permanent mark on him. This is someone who&apos;s lived through the AIDS epidemic and the swine flu pandemic, cared personally for Ebola patients and now finds himself dealing with a virus that has long been his worst fear. But they insist he would remember this one high-school basketball game. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I would bet a lot of money on it,&quot; Burns said. </p>
<p>
     Fauci couldn&apos;t be reached to reminisce about his high-school basketball career. </p>
<p>
     It would take more than six decades for the other team&apos;s star player to find out the name of Regis&apos;s captain. Fordham Prep&apos;s star that season was an all-city guard named Donnie Walsh who played at the University of North Carolina, coached the Denver Nuggets and built the Indiana Pacers and his hometown Knicks. Not until last week did he discover that he also crossed paths with a doctor he now admires on television. &quot;I am sure Regis is proud to have him as an alumnus,&quot; Walsh said in an email. </p>
<p>
     The other players on that Regis team keep tabs on Fauci by turning on their TVs and watching the rest of the nation come to respect him. </p>
<p>
     On the day in January when the White House announced its coronavirus task force -- another team of 12 people who treat Fauci as their captain -- Higney sent him an email with the subject line &quot;Note from Regis Classmate&quot; not knowing if he would hear back. Fauci responded that night. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I hope that you are well,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Those were indeed the good old days.&quot; </p>

Early Peloton Investor Sells a Big Block of Stock -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Ed Lin </pre>
<p>
     Peloton Interactive stock continues to trade below its initial-public-offering price, but one early investor still made substantial amounts of money when selling shares this month. </p>
<p>
     Peloton stock (ticker: PTON) hasn&apos;t quite capitalized on the closures of gyms and a lifestyle shift to the home couch for office workers amid the coronavirus outbreak. Shares closed at $25.98 on Friday for a year-to-date loss of 8.5% compared with a 21.3% drop in the S&amp;P 500 index, a measure of the broader market. Peloton&apos;s closing price is 10.4% below the $29 IPO price in September, but the stock has rebounded from mid-March, when shares had slipped to the teens. </p>
<p>
     Hadley Harbor Master Investors (Cayman) L.P., a fund of investment firm Wellington Management Group, has sold 5 million Peloton shares so far this month for a total of $126.9 million, an average price per share of $25.57, according to forms it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>
     Wellington Management declined to comment on the Peloton stock sales. </p>

<p>
     Hadley Harbor has apparently already recouped its Peloton investment, by Barron&apos;s calculations. It had bought about $60 million in convertible preferred stock over 2017 and 2018. The fund converted those shares to 9.9 million supervoting class B Peloton shares in September. Each class B share carries 20 votes per share, while Peloton&apos;s publicly traded shares carry one vote each. Each class B share can be converted to a publicly traded share at any time. On Feb. 11, Hadley Harbor converted those class B shares into 9.9 million publicly traded shares. The so-called IPO lockup period expired about two weeks after that, allowing early investors and insiders to sell shares on the open market. </p>
<p>
     Hadley Harbor began selling Peloton stock on March 17, and its most recent reported sale was March 25. </p>
<p>
     Hadley Harbor now directly owns 4.9 million Peloton shares, valued at $128.9 million, based on Friday&apos;s close. </p>
<p>
     Inside Scoop is a regular Barron&apos;s feature covering stock transactions by corporate executives and board members -- so-called insiders -- as well as large shareholders, politicians, and other prominent figures. Due to their insider status, these investors are required to disclose stock trades with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory groups. </p>

The New Relief Package Helps Investors In HSAs And FSAs -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Karen Hube </pre>
<p>
     The $2.2 trillion economic stimulus approved by the House of Representatives on Friday will make it more affordable and easier for families to manage their healthcare needs. </p>
<p>
     The healthcare provisions under the package, which requires approval from President Trump before going into effect, will be particularly welcome to families with high-deductible health insurance plans and either health savings accounts (HSAs) or flexible spending account (FSAs), which are pre-tax savings accounts specifically for healthcare expenses. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The idea is to free up people to get the care they need and physicians to offer services without a lot of extra time and human contact,&quot; says Alison Moore, vice president of Health Marketing at HealthSavings, an HSA provider. </p>
<p>
     The massive stimulus package, approved unanimously by the Senate on Wednesday night and passed by the House in a voice vote on Friday, aims infuse cash into individual and business coffers to ease the brunt of the massive economic setback brought on by the rampant virus. </p>
<p>
     Adding to the Families First Corona Response bill passed by Congress earlier in March to make all Covid-19 virus testing free, the new bill layers on the following healthcare related changes: </p>
<p>
     -- Healthcare insurance policies that provide coverage for tele-health services -- meaning medical consultations via video or phone -- must waive deductible requirements. Regardless of how much more you have to go before meeting your annual deductible, your insurer must extend full coverage for remote services. </p>
<p>
     -- Rules for what HSA and FSA accounts can be used for were relaxed, now allowing pre-tax dollars to be used for over-the-counter medications -- anything from Alka Seltzer to acetaminophen. </p>
<p>
     This essentially reverses the rules governing these accounts to before the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which narrowed the use of HSA and FSA dollars to prescription medications. </p>
<p>
     Both of these accounts allow workers to contribute pre-tax dollars and withdraw them tax-free, as long as they are used for qualified medical expenses. Unused HSA funds can be rolled into future years. FSA funds must be used within the year they are contributed, plus a grace period of a couple of months. </p>
<p>
     -- For the first time, HSA and FSA funds can be used to buy menstrual products. </p>
<p>
     -- While annual limits on pre-tax contributions to an HSA or FSA haven&apos;t changed, the deadline for making a single year&apos;s contribution to the accounts are aligned with the tax-filing deadline, and are therefore extended for 2019. The tax-filing deadline for 2019 has been moved from April 15 to July 15. </p>
<p>
     The maximum contribution to an HSA is $3,500 for 2019 and $3,550 for 2020. For FSAs, it is $2,700 for 2019 and $2,750 this year. </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, certain existing HSA rules may also go a long way toward helping families whose finances have been hit hard by reduced hours or layoffs, Moore says. </p>
<p>
     While HSAs can&apos;t be used to pay employer-provided insurance premiums, they can be used by unemployed folks to pay premiums on an independent policy or on coverage through COBRA (The consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act), which is an extension of an employer-provided insurance program for employees who have been laid off. </p>
<p>
     And if you carefully trace your spending footsteps over past years, you may be able to find reimbursable expenses, she says. HSA rules allow you to take money out of your account, tax free, to pay yourself back for out-of-pocked expenses that could have been paid with your pre-tax dollars. </p>
<p>
     If over past years you have paid for your prescription medications or qualified expenses such as reading glasses or dentist or orthodontist bills, you can pay yourself back if you have a record of the expenses -- receipts are best, but a credit card statement will suffice, Moore says. </p>

First-Quarter Earnings Will Be Ugly. These Data Might Tell Us How Bad. -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Evie Liu </pre>
<p>
     Corporate earnings for this quarter are expected to be some of the worst on record, but no one knows how exactly how bad. Data that go beyond companies&apos; financial forecasts, many of which haven&apos;t been updated to reflect the latest coronavirus damage, offer a glimpse at what industries and companies have been affected the most. </p>
<p>
     The news isn&apos;t all bad. </p>
<p>
     According to data from FactSet, while nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 companies discussed the effects of the coronavirus on their businesses in the latest earnings calls, more than 90% of the calls were in January or February. That was before the virus hit the U.S. hard and consumers dramatically changed their behavior. </p>
<p>
     As of March 20, only 13 companies had revised their guidance in recent weeks to include the epidemic&apos;s latest impact, while another 11 had withdrawn or suspended their previous forecasts because the outlook is too uncertain. The remaining companies either haven&apos;t provided updates, or left their previous guidance unchanged. </p>
<p>
     Data tracking foot traffic and online transactions, from a variety of sources, though, offer a view of what is happening at malls, big-box retailers, supermarkets, in fast food, and even with production of mask respirators, in short supply since the outbreak hit the U.S. Some of the findings are expected; some came as a surprise. </p>
<p>
     Trouble at the Mall </p>
<p>
     Americans were going to shopping malls as normal until the end of February, despite the emerging pandemic threat, but visits began to decline sharply at the beginning of March, according to Placer.ai, a location-data analytics company that tracks more than 30 million mobile devices in the U.S. Foot traffic doesn&apos;t directly translate into sales, but usually has a strong correlation. </p>
<p>
     While the impact has been broad-based, the Westfield San Francisco Center and Westfield Southcenter Seattle, among the 11 malls analyzed across the country, showed the most significant year-over-year foot-traffic drops in the first week of March. Both areas have been at the forefront of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. </p>
<p>
     Data from the second week of the month show that malls in other highly populated areas. such as the Mall at Short Hills in Millburn, N.J., and the Galleria Mall in Houston, Texas, have caught up, with year-over-year declines in visits of more than 35%. Many states and cities have announced &quot;shelter-in-place&quot; or &quot;stay-at-home&quot; policies, so malls, considered nonessential businesses, are likely to see zero visits for an unknown period. </p>
<p>
     A Wholesale Boom </p>
<p>
     It has been widely reported that shoppers have been crowding wholesale and big-box retailers like Costco Wholesale (ticker: COST) and Walmart (WMT) due to the virus-triggered panic. In the last week of February, visits to Costco and Walmart&apos;s Sam&apos;s Club chain were 13.2% and 9% higher, respectively, than in the year-ago period, according to Placer. </p>
<p>
     The trend intensified in the first week of March, with respective growth of 18.3% and 21%. Target (TGT) and Walmart stores have also seen major increases in foot traffic. </p>
<p>
     Supermarkets and Grocery Stores </p>
<p>
     Unlike wholesale and big-box retailers, supermarkets didn&apos;t see a surge in visits until the second week of March, when the coronavirus outbreak truly hit America and people started stocking up on food in preparation for possible lockdowns. Foot traffic at Albertsons surged 40% from the year-earlier period. At Kroger (KR), the figure was 36%, while 27% more people visited a Wegmans store. </p>
<p>
     Even brands that weren&apos;t doing so well earlier in the year have benefited. Foot traffic at Publix, for example, was down 5.3% year over year in the last week of February and off 6.2% in the first week of March, but surged 19% in the second week of the month, the Placer numbers show. </p>
<p>
     Fast Food Is Doing Fine </p>
<p>
     Fast-food chains, interestingly, have been relatively resilient, given that fear of the coronavirus might have made people hesitate to dine out. During the last week of February and first week of March, total visits to McDonald&apos;s (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), and Burger King locations across the nation -- despite some retreat -- have remained largely flat from the year-earlier periods. Popeyes, Chick-fil-A, and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) -- brands that have been growing faster -- continued to see notable increases in visits. </p>
<p>
     To be sure, the data cover a time before many states and cities implemented social-distancing policies and banned dining at restaurants. The fast-food business has since shifted to take-out and delivery in those areas, which will only partly be reflected in the foot-traffic data. </p>
<p>
     A Hiccup for Meal Deliveries </p>
<p>
     Another data-analytics firm, M Science, tracks transaction data on a few major meal-delivery platforms such as DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub (GRUB). The firm says spending growth for the industry decelerated to a year-over-year rate of 15.4% in the first two months of 2020, down from 31.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Growth in the services&apos; customer bases is slowing as well, falling to 18.0% from 31.9% in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>
     DoorDash--with the strongest growth--saw spending rise 56.0% in the first quarter through March 2 from the year-ago period, compared with 99.6% growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. Uber Eats growth has slowed meaningfully as well, while Grubhub has fared better, with faster growth than last quarter. A new loyalty program might have encouraged customers to stick with the service and to order more often, noted M Science. </p>
<p>
     Again, these data only cover periods before the &quot;stay-at-home&quot; mandates, which should boost demand for deliveries. </p>
<p>
     Keeping Safe </p>
<p>
     Coupa, a company that managed more than $500 billion in spending for clients ranging from Toyota to Lululemon last year, said its clients spent 33% more on office-sanitizing equipment and 75% more on personal-protective equipment in February than they did in the same month last year. </p>
<p>
     3M (MMM), one of the major manufacturers of N95 mask respirators, has been ramping up production since January and plans to double production over the next year. According to geospatial analytics company Orbital Insight, foot traffic at 3M&apos;s personal-safety division plant in Valley, Neb., has surged about 35% since late January as compared to the year-ago period. Many employees were asked to work overtime in anticipation of a surge in demand. </p>
<p>
     CEO Mike Roman has said that sales of face masks could approach $250 million through the coronavirus outbreak, but it&apos;s important to put that number in perspective. 3M generated more than $32 billion in total revenue last year, about 11% of it from the personal-safety division, so $250 million in mask revenue wouldn&apos;t move the needle. </p>

Calls to Companies Rise Amid Coronavirus, but Operators Aren&apos;t Standing By</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Sharon Terlep and Sarah Krouse </pre>
<p>
     America&apos;s biggest companies are racing to overhaul customer-service operations that are ill-equipped to have employees working from home amid a pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Many customers who call the hotlines of airlines, retailers and financial-services firms, among others, encounter hourslong wait times, hearing recorded messages saying help is currently unavailable. Some companies ask that customers manage their issues online or suggest that they hold off on seeking assistance altogether. </p>
<p>
     Over the past three decades, companies&apos; call centers and customer-help centers have shifted overseas and are now concentrated in regions of the world hard hit by the new coronavirus. Meantime, customer-service setups in the U.S., often densely packed with employees, are either shutting down or downsizing amid containment efforts. </p>
<p>
     Companies trying to set up employees to work from home, both in the U.S. and abroad, have to figure out how to ensure secure networks and phone lines in an age where cybersecurity is vital. Some of the most-needed services, such as banking and health-care, involve especially sensitive information. </p>
<p>
     Businesses are scrambling for temp workers and using bots to help filter callers who need a live person from those who can be helped in other ways. </p>
<p>
     &quot;At every company...all the call-center folks are getting an email from the CEO saying, &apos;What&apos;s the plan if I have to vacate&apos;&quot; workers from the office, said Pat Gibbons, marketing chief for customer-service consulting firm Walker Information Inc. Mr. Gibbons said he had stopped taking on new clients to free up resources for existing ones. </p>
<p>
     So far, human contact is in short supply. The American Express Co. login page is topped with a message, in red letters, warning of long wait times and encouraging people to &quot;use our digital tools.&quot; British Airways&apos; customer-service line to manage flight reservations has played a message to call back later or visit the company&apos;s website. Calling the toll-free number for Procter &amp; Gamble Co.&apos;s Charmin brand toilet paper tells people looking for bathroom tissue that the company is working &quot;as fast as humanly possible&quot; to supply retailers and ends with, &quot;We hope you are able to find it in stores soon,&quot; before disconnecting. </p>
<p>
     &quot;You have these big rooms with 1,000 people sitting a foot and a half from each other, and the moment something like [Covid-19] pops out, you&apos;ve got to thin them out,&quot; said Rick Bloom, CEO of Support.com, a Sunnyvale, Calif., firm that provides customer-service software and staff for companies who outsource and is hiring hundreds of workers to keep up with demand. </p>
<p>
     Internet providers face an influx of demand as American workers and school children shift to working and learning online, respectively. Airlines, which are sustaining losses as flights are grounded world-wide, are being inundated with calls from customers needing flight changes, refunds or help getting home. </p>
<p>
     Javon Johnson, a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, recently drove to the airport to speak to a United Airlines Holdings Inc.&apos;s customer-service agent in person after efforts to recover $2,000 spent on canceled flights proved fruitless. </p>
<p>
     United&apos;s call volumes initially doubled amid the coronavirus spread, a company spokeswoman said. The company enlisted employees from across its business, including senior executives, to take customer calls. Call volume has since declined, she said, while call wait times have almost returned to normal. </p>
<p>
     Companies that equip call centers with technical infrastructure and cloud services say the deluge of calls to consumer-facing businesses began with travelers and has shifted to consumers calling makers of in-demand products such as toilet paper and diapers, investors calling financial institutions, and patients calling health systems and insurers, among others. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The needs of how to deal with that needed to be massively reconfigured in real time,&quot; said Jeff Lawson, chief executive of cloud-communications company Twilio Inc. &quot;There was the trickle, and then there was the wave, and then there was a tsunami.&quot; </p>
<p>
     American companies employ roughly 2.9 million customer-service workers, up 30% from a decade earlier, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>
<p>
     Data are lacking on how many U.S. jobs have been shifted overseas. Many of the biggest U.S. corporations, from Target Corp. to American Express, have operations in either or both the Philippines and India, which are the largest providers of call-center work to American companies. The Philippines has outpaced India, with more than one million call-center workers and continues to grow, according to the IT &amp; Business Process Association of the Philippines. </p>
<p>
     Both nations have been affected by the coronavirus spread. India ordered a complete lockdown Tuesday of its 1.3 billion citizens. Earlier this month, police and army troops worked to seal off the Philippine capital of Manila and the surrounding area, home to more than 12 million people. </p>
<p>
     Where working from home in the U.S. can be glitchy and frustrating for call-center workers, it is impossible for many overseas, analysts say. Workers are often poor and lack laptops or internet connections. In the Philippines, containment efforts aren&apos;t uniform across regions so workers face varying challenges, from blocked-off roadways to stay-at-home mandates. </p>
<p>
     Further complicating matters: Call centers are sometimes technological holdouts, with many still reliant on traditional on-premises, business-telephone systems, rather than portable, cloud-based services, said Gregg Johnson, chief executive of call-tracking and analytics firm Invoca. Many have long been centrally managed operations centers with little need to send workers elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     To manage the traffic, some companies are creating bot-based answer systems that attempt to siphon off some calls to automated systems and place a priority on only those that require person-to-person interaction. </p>
<p>
     In health care, the bot-based systems may use prompts to advise patients to stay home or give other treatment tips. More severe cases may be transmitted to a video consult, with only the most extreme cases escalating to an in-person hospital or doctor&apos;s visit. </p>
<p>
     At Verizon Communications Inc., thousands of call-center agents were part of a normal work-from-home rotation before the pandemic, but trying to move the majority of them to remote workstations required new equipment, security measures and connectivity. </p>
<p>
     Sending agents home requires computers formatted with adequate security and workflow systems as well as a broadband connection that can accommodate voice-over-internet calls and a headset. </p>
<p>
     Nearly all of Verizon&apos;s 17,000 call-center workers were working remotely by Friday, a spokesman said. </p>

How to Look Professional -- From the Waist Up At Least -- While Coronavirus Keeps Many Working From Home</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Ray A. Smith </pre>
<p>
     To get ready for a work video conference call last Tuesday, Elizabeth DiGeorgio applied a full face of makeup, fixed her hair and put on a nice shirt. But before she joined the call, she had to talk her husband, also working from home, into wearing pants. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I had to inform him that pants were not optional, and that he could not walk through behind me, people would be able to see him,&quot; said Ms. DiGeorgio, a 53-year-old Jacksonville, Fla., resident who works in real estate, referring to her husband, who was wearing basketball shorts. &quot;It was necessary. The difference between just a conversation and a video call kind of changes some stuff.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Deciding what to wear when working from home has become harder than it used to be due to coronavirus-mandated social distancing. Often in the past, at least one participant on the video call was based in an office where some kind of dress code was in effect. But with virtually everyone telecommuting, working from home is now a sartorial Wild West, with no dress code and employees juggling more responsibilities than just work. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I had to do a conference call with no pants on last week because my toddler fell in a puddle,&quot; said Amy Rothwell, the business development lead at a coaching and consulting firm in Bolton, England. Shortly before her 11 a.m. video business call on March 20, Ms. Rothwell, 36, took her 18-month-old son out for some fresh air. </p>
<p>
     &quot;He fell in a puddle, and I had to carry him home and I was covered in mud,&quot; she said. In normal times, grandparents would look after the boy. Now running late for the call, she scrambled to wash her face, wear a clean sweater, fix her hair in a ponytail, and apply some lipstick. But, &quot;I couldn&apos;t find any other jeans, so I had no pants on.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ms. Rothwell unintentionally wore a popular work-from-home style with work-appropriate clothes on the visible upper half of the body, while wearing sweats, leggings, shorts, pajama pants or underwear. It is a style her husband, Martyn, an auditor, wears. &quot;He has to wear a shirt and tie for work, so he will wear the shirt and tie with boxers&quot; when on video calls, Ms. Rothwell said, adding the look makes her laugh. </p>
<p>
     Numerous Twitter users have bragged about the subversiveness of conducting video meetings in their underwear or pajama bottoms. &quot;Not gonna lie -- I have a meeting today that I have to Skype in for and I&apos;m very excited to do it while wearing a dress shirt and no pants!&quot; tweeted Nick Puschnig, a 37-year-old accountant in Milwaukee, recently. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I was going to wear a button-down shirt with sport shorts, but unfortunately the meeting got canceled so I didn&apos;t get to do it,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;So I went back and changed into sweatpants.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Puschnig, who typically wears button-down shirts and dress pants to his business-casual office, said his work-from-home look so far consists of sweatpants, a hooded sweatshirt and a baseball hat, and he&apos;s debating whether to put in more effort. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, a social worker, who lives with him, &quot;has actually gotten up early like usual and gotten dressed like she normally would.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Of his look, &quot;she hasn&apos;t made a comment yet on it, but I feel it coming, &quot; he said. He plans to wear his dress shirt with shorts for the next scheduled call. &quot;I&apos;m certainly not going to put on dress pants if I don&apos;t have to.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The disruption also means some people aren&apos;t looking as crisp as usual because they haven&apos;t been able to visit barbers, hairdressers, nail salons, gyms and dry cleaners. But employees generally shouldn&apos;t give off an appearance of slacking off just because they are working from home. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Everyone should maintain professionalism,&quot; said Aliza Licht, a marketing consultant and author of career-advice book, &quot;Leave Your Mark.&quot; She recommended employees get dressed -- at least from the waist up -- and put on makeup as if they were going to the office. &quot;I think when you get dressed, you&apos;re more confident, you perform better,&quot; she said. Whether it is with co-workers, on client calls or in external meetings, &quot;You still have to bring it,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I still get up at the same time every morning, take a shower, put on my makeup and get dressed for work, even though I am not leaving the house, &quot; said Emily Reeves Dean, a 41-year-old digital marketer in Little Rock, Ark. Her look is usually something professional on top with leggings and slippers. &quot;I do several video calls each day, and I just want to make sure I look like I am making an effort for the people that have to see me big on their screens.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Some employees are making exceptions in the interest of boosting morale during a stressful time. </p>
<p>
     Tim Gill, a 35-year-old professor at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, woke up from a nap on March 23 to find his wife, Aiola, conducting a lecture for 17 students on videoconferencing platform Zoom wearing a &quot;Friends&quot; T-shirt and purple Mardi Gras beads. &quot;I just decided to kind of dress casually that day for the class just to kind of normalize the situation and loosen the atmosphere for my students, because I know everyone is scared and anxious,&quot; said Ms. Gill, 35, an academic adviser at the school who teaches freshman seminar classes. </p>
<p>
     Suzanne Park, whose first novel, &quot;The Perfect Escape,&quot; comes out in April, recently walked in on her husband, Trevor Foucher, a software engineer, participating in a work conference call wearing a safari hat. &quot;I caught glimpses of the call and some of them had on hats,&quot; said Ms. Park, who lives in Los Angeles. There were furry hats, fedoras and even &quot;some Daniel Boone type of hats. I just walked out.&quot; Ms. Park said her husband later told her that at one point someone put on a hat thinking it would be funny &quot;and then it just started cascading.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For a March 23 videoconference call, Nicholas De Salvo, who runs a digital marketing agency in Portland, Ore., with his wife, Megan, thought wearing a sweatshirt he bought from an employee who designs them would be a mood booster. Then the employee, web designer Jake Olsen, popped up on the call, wearing the same sweatshirt. &quot;It was a fun moment, &quot; Mr. De Salvo said. </p>
<p>
     How to Look Your Best on a Video Work Call </p>
<p>
     Use Jewel Tones: Anne D. Stills, president of the Association of Image Consultants International&apos;s New York tri-state chapter, recommends a polished look -- blouses, button-downs or pullover sweaters. Search your closet for jewel tones, which &quot;can make your skin glow.&quot; Meanwhile, colors that flatter all skin and hair colors include teal, turquoise, true red, navy, periwinkle and blush. Beware of patterns, which &quot;can be distracting and make the viewer dizzy.&quot; Be mindful that the garment fits well. </p>
<p>
     Ditch The Tie: &quot;It would look odd for someone to show up to a Zoom meeting in a full suit and tie,&quot; said Julie Rath, founder and president of Rath &amp; Co. Men&apos;s Style Consulting. &quot;A neat button-up shirt would be an apt replacement. It&apos;s both realistic and respectful.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Don&apos;t Be Extra: Now might not be the time to join calls in flashy designer clothing or something over the top. &quot;It&apos;s the fashion equivalent of tone deaf,&quot; said Aliza Licht, a marketing consultant and author of career-advice book, &quot;Leave Your Mark.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Keep It Professional: &quot;I would say &apos;neat casual&apos; is the WFH dress code right now,&quot; said Ms. Rath. &quot;One thing to be mindful of however is wrinkles, as they can be amplified over video. You don&apos;t have to break out the steamer before you log in, but make sure you aren&apos;t grabbing a crumpled up shirt from the floor.&quot; She&apos;s not a fan of being dressed on top, but not on bottom. &quot;What if you have to jump up from your laptop to let your dog out of the room while on a video call? Your underdressed bottom half may have an unintended reveal.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Grooming: &quot;If you&apos;re typically clean shaven, a little scruff is fine,&quot; Ms. Rath said. &quot;Overall, use common sense and good judgment based on whom you&apos;re meeting with and what you want to convey. And make sure to take a look in the mirror before you go online.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Hair and Makeup: &quot;The hair is very important because your face is the focus of your presentation,&quot; said Ms. Stills. With salons closed, she suggests women brush their hair into a ponytail. &quot;For those women who may have short hair, just comb it back and put a lovely headband on it. That gives just a very elegant, clean look.&quot; Makeup is a must, she said. &quot;The camera will definitely make you look washed out. Even for women who don&apos;t wear makeup, I still encourage them to wear simple makeup for the camera.&quot; She also recommends mascara and eyeliner and colored lipstick. </p>
<p>
     Setting: &quot;If they don&apos;t want people to necessarily see their homes, Zoom has a background feature,&quot; said Ms. Stills. Zoom says the feature works best with a green screen and uniform lighting. Ms. Stills recommends women &quot;wear a color that contrasts well with the background.&quot; Adds Ms. Rath, &quot;It&apos;s also good to avoid wearing the same color as your background. Otherwise, you can blend in and look like a floating head.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Lighting: &quot;You have to have good lighting and that light is not behind you, the light is in front of you,&quot; said Ms. Stills. Here are some more tips on improving your lighting and background. </p>

After Three Coronavirus Stimulus Packages, Congress Is Already Prepping Phase Four</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jacob M. Schlesinger and Joshua Jamerson </pre>
<p>
     As lawmakers last week completed a record-shattering economic-rescue package estimated at $2 trillion, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) predicted: &quot;This is certainly not the end of our work here in Congress -- rather the end of the beginning.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Legislators from both parties, administration officials, economists, think tanks and lobbyists are already roughing out the contours of yet another emergency-spending package -- perhaps larger than the last -- to try to keep the coronavirus crisis from turning into a 21st-century Great Depression. Many expect the debate to begin in earnest by late April. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There&apos;s talk of a multi-trillion-dollar program, given the size of the shutdown,&quot; says Stephen Moore, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. &quot;There&apos;s a general recognition that we need something big to get some juice into the economy,&quot; adds Mr. Moore, an outside economic consultant to the Trump administration and some congressional Republicans. </p>
<p>
     The ideas being floated include extending last week&apos;s package to make the benefits last longer, as well as plugging in likely holes in the hastily assembled bill. One item in particular cited by both President Trump and Democratic leaders is a desire for more money to shore up state government budgets collapsing under lost tax revenues and new spending demands. </p>
<p>
     A common theme from economists and legislators across the political spectrum: The latest measure was mainly about keeping U.S. commerce on life support while it endures a medically induced coma. That is, paying businesses and workers revenues and wages lost during the shutdown. A next phase would likely pivot from stabilization to stimulus -- providing the patient a robust regimen of physical therapy in an attempt to get the economy back to full health. </p>
<p>
     Action so far has been &quot;about mitigation,&quot; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said at a Thursday press conference. &quot;Next, we&apos;ll go from emergency mitigation to recovery...to grow the economy and create more jobs.&quot; She later called the new law &quot;a very big down payment.&quot; </p>
<p>
     As the coronavirus has ravaged U.S. business over the past month, lawmakers have reacted with uncharacteristic speed and unity to try to contain the damage. In just three weeks, a divided Congress has passed three major pieces of legislation to address the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Phase one, which President Trump signed March 3, provided $8.3 billion in fresh funds for health agencies and testing, and for small-business loan subsidies. Phase two, enacted March 18 and worth about $100 billion, had tax credits for employers offering paid sick leave, and increases to unemployment benefits and food assistance. The phase-three package of roughly $2-trillion, completed Friday, includes checks to households, bailouts for airlines and other distressed industries, and loans and grants for small business. </p>
<p>
     One question hanging over what is already being called &quot;Phase Four&quot; is whether that spirit of urgency and compromise can continue as the downturn advances. Or, will Washington return to the polarization that has often paralyzed Congress in recent years -- especially as the November elections erode incentives for cross-party cooperation? </p>
<p>
     Another concern: Legislating amid travel restrictions and the risk that more in Congress come down with the disease. </p>
<p>
     Policy makers and economists will need to assess in coming weeks whether the most recent package does enough to tide over companies and workers through the end of the shutdown -- whenever that occurs -- or whether prolonged closures require another dosage of the same medicine. </p>
<p>
     The aid in the latest measure was calculated to help small businesses cover about eight weeks of payroll. That should be sufficient if the economy largely reopens by late May. But that is still far from certain. A longer quarantine might require, at a minimum, renewal of the same assistance. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It wouldn&apos;t make a lot of sense to keep the ecosystem of commerce alive for two months, just to kill it in nine weeks by not extending that program,&quot; said Michael Strain, an economist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, who has been working with GOP lawmakers on crisis-response measures. </p>
<p>
     A bigger debate is emerging over whether Congress needs to do more, even if the disease crests by late spring. Some conservatives who supported the latest measure will likely be more hesitant about further action, worried that the crisis might turn into a permanent expansion of government intervention in the private sector. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I would hope anybody that&apos;s talking about a phase four would pause right now,&quot; House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said Friday on Fox News. &quot;Let&apos;s make sure this is actually working in the process and be smart, get the data back of where -- if -- we do need more help.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Momentum might also be slowed by the second-guessing that inevitably follows big-spending programs, especially one thrown together so quickly. &quot;My guess is that this bill won&apos;t wear well over time, and Congress isn&apos;t going to be inclined do another big package,&quot; says  Andy Laperriere, a Washington policy analyst with Cornerstone Macro, an investor advisory firm. &quot;There will be fraud, companies getting money going into bankruptcy, things that people on the left and right won&apos;t like.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Any debate over new spending will likely reopen the ideological splits that were largely papered over during the past few weeks. &quot;The left is going to want to do infrastructure, welfare payments and food stamps,&quot; says Mr. Moore. &quot;Our side will want to do tax cuts and deregulation.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Moore has discussed with administration officials and congressional Republicans the idea of suspending the payroll tax through the end of the year, which he estimates would cost about $700 billion. Mr. Trump had pushed that idea early in the crisis, but withdrew it amid bipartisan objections on Capitol Hill. </p>
<p>
     The top agenda item for many Democrats is adding to the $150 billion the just-passed law doled out to state governments. Many analysts consider that insufficient. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo branded the measure &quot;really terrible for the state of New York,&quot; saying the $4 billion his hard-hit state is slated to receive could be less than a third of the pandemic-induced budget shortfall. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We don&apos;t want states to say they can&apos;t hire teachers or anybody else because they spent all their money on the coronavirus,&quot; says Jay Shambaugh, director of the left-leaning Hamilton Project think tank and who was an economic adviser to President Obama. </p>
<p>
     At the signing ceremony for the latest bill, Mr. Trump on Friday also indicated there was White House support for further state aid &quot;because the states have been hurt very badly.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mrs. Pelosi has said in recent days she would push for free health-care coverage for coronavirus patients and more money to shore up pension funds and food stamps. Many House Democrats want more funding for the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Postal Service. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has called for funds to forgive student-loan debts, as well as increased Social Security checks to aid at-risk seniors. </p>
<p>
     Given the uncertainty of forecasts -- both around the spread of the disease and the state of the economy -- many economists want Congress to implement so-called automatic stabilizers in a next bill: payments such as enhanced unemployment insurance that would immediately kick in if the economy remains weak, without requiring new legislative approval. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The logistics of ramping up are much more complicated when you have to protect workers and consumers from a secondary outbreak,&quot; says  Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton LLP. </p>
<p>
     Many simply want more time to analyze the problem and to craft a more thoroughly vetted response. &quot;There&apos;s real interest in the next phase being more deliberate, more thoughtful, more tailored,&quot; says Steph Sterling, vice president for advocacy and policy at the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute, who has been consulting with Democrats on Capitol Hill. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There&apos;s a recognition of the optics of the scramble,&quot; Ms. Sterling says, &quot;and for more real analysis of what&apos;s needed next.&quot; </p>

Joe Biden Points to Ebola Experience in Pitching Coronavirus Plan</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Sabrina Siddiqui and Warren P. Strobel </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- A virus declared by the World Health Organization to be an outbreak threatened to proliferate across the globe, bringing with it stock market turbulence and international panic. </p>
<p>
     The 2014 Ebola outbreak differed from the novel coronavirus in key respects, health experts say, but former Vice President Joe Biden says his work on that crisis shows how he would combat and contain a lethal and highly infectious disease if elected president. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, is looking to leverage that experience against President Trump, casting himself as someone who would be a steady leader in a crisis that has overtaken campaigning for the November election. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Biden knows how to mount an effective crisis response and elevate the voices of scientists, public health experts, and first responders,&quot; Mr. Biden&apos;s campaign website reads. &quot;He helped lead the Obama-Biden Administration&apos;s effective response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the 2014 Ebola epidemic.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Interviews with former Obama administration officials found Mr. Biden wasn&apos;t at the center of the response to Ebola, which was overseen by President Obama personally. &quot;The president wanted to own this, and the president did own this,&quot; said Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the U.S. Agency for International Development&apos;s office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance at the time and helped implement the Ebola response. </p>
<p>
     But, officials said, Mr. Biden at times played key roles in helping coordinate domestic and international efforts to combat the disease. And his chief of staff at the time, Ron Klain, was tapped by Mr. Obama in 2014 as the administration&apos;s Ebola czar. Those experiences tie in to a key argument Mr. Biden has made for his 2020 candidacy: that his relationships on Capitol Hill and with foreign leaders would allow him to quickly take the helm of the U.S. government and lead it effectively. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Klain, now an adviser to Mr. Biden&apos;s campaign, said the former vice president was a fixture in the Situation Room for Ebola discussions and credited Mr. Biden with helping to secure a $5.4 billion supplemental package from Congress. </p>
<p>
     &quot;He played a big role in bringing along all the different stakeholders, whether that was going to Capitol Hill to sell our funding package or working with state and local officials as we tried to coordinate our response,&quot; Mr. Klain said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Klain, who has advised Mr. Biden on his coronavirus plan, said the Trump administration&apos;s failure to quickly scale up testing for the virus had allowed it to spread widely across the U.S. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you would&apos;ve had more robust testing in January, you could have relied on more traditional public health measures, like the ones we used in Africa, where you identify who has the disease, you identify who they&apos;re in contact with, you do contract tracing, and you try to really figure out where the disease is and where the disease isn&apos;t,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Mr. Trump&apos;s reelection campaign, accused Mr. Biden of engaging in partisan politics. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It used to be that Americans faced national adversity with unity, but Joe Biden has abandoned that principle in favor of rank, despicable politics,&quot; Mr. Murtaugh said in a statement. &quot;Americans can see that President Trump is leading the nation through this war with the coronavirus, and they can also see that Joe Biden has decided to be the opposition in that battle. All for politics, and because he wants to be president so badly.&quot; </p>
<p>
     There are differences between the 2014 experience and the current threat. The Ebola epidemic remained largely contained in West Africa. Unlike the coronavirus, the Ebola virus is transmitted via contaminated bodily fluids and not in droplets through the air. And while those infected with coronavirus but without symptoms can pass the virus on to others, the same isn&apos;t believed to be true of Ebola. </p>
<p>
     Despite widespread fears of a U.S. Ebola epidemic, only four cases occurred in the U.S., excluding victims medically evacuated from West Africa, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those four, one patient died. </p>
<p>
     Nonetheless, a poll in mid-October 2014 found that two-thirds of Americans were concerned about a widespread epidemic in the U.S. Another poll that month found that nearly half of Americans thought Ebola was as much or more of a threat than Islamic State. </p>
<p>
     In mid-September 2014, Mr. Obama announced the deployment of 3,000 U.S. troops to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea to help their governments cope with the Ebola outbreak. Ben Rhodes, a former national security adviser to Mr. Obama, said Mr. Biden worked the phones to recruit other countries to send health-care workers and supplies to the region. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We had several dozen countries that ultimately deployed health-care workers or contributed supplies and funding for the broader international effort,&quot; said Mr. Rhodes. &quot;It&apos;s illustrative of the role Biden played generally in the Obama administration, where his experience with Congress and with foreign leaders made him a critical resource when you had a government priority like an epidemic.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In a midterm election year when the administration was also grappling with Islamic State&apos;s rise and a surge of unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border, Mr. Obama faced growing calls, led by Republicans, to ban travel from West African countries hit by Ebola. </p>
<p>
     The administration was confident that it had in place an effective system to screen travelers and isolate anyone who might have contracted the disease. Still, in late October, Mr. Obama gathered top officials inside the Situation Room for an at times contentious discussion about the calls for travel restrictions. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Biden was the last person to speak and forcefully rejected calls to change course, Mr. Klain said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We needed to take the heat and stick with it,&quot; Mr. Klain recalled of Mr. Biden&apos;s message. The administration ultimately didn&apos;t ban travel to those countries, relying on screening travelers instead. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Biden also helped mediate conversations with transportation unions who raised concerns about potential exposure to Ebola and in a November meeting at the White House enlisted faith and humanitarian organizations to help pressure lawmakers on Capitol Hill to pass a funding package. </p>
<p>
     J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the administration mounted an effective response, despite some initial debates and hesitation. </p>
<p>
     &quot;After protracted and dangerous delays, in which things got out of control...we did finally swing into action,&quot; Mr. Morrison, who didn&apos;t serve in the Obama administration, said of the U.S. response. &quot;And when we did, we had major impact.&quot; </p>

Logistics Firms Endeavor to Keep Goods Moving as Much of Economy Shuts Down</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jennifer Smith </pre>
<p>
     Warehouse operators across the U.S. are sanitizing workplaces, providing protective gear to workers and separating staff as they try to keep supply chains running while much of the country&apos;s economy shuts down amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Some businesses, such as TJX Cos., the parent of discount retailer T.J. Maxx, have suspended distribution and fulfillment operations in pre-emptive actions aimed at containing the pandemic. E-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. temporarily shut two U.S. sites after workers there tested positive for Covid-19. The company said one has reopened and the other is scheduled to open April 1. </p>
<p>
     The efforts are part of increasingly aggressive actions logistics companies are taking to ensure goods continue to move through distribution networks, both to anxious consumers who have been stockpiling food and household supplies and, more critically, to hospitals and health-care providers under strain as coronavirus cases mount across the U.S. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s a scary situation for all of us, but we know how important it is for our truck drivers to be here, for our warehouse people to be here,&quot; said Richie Laecca, a 60-year-old warehouse dock foreman at Imperial Dade, a food-service and janitorial products distributor based in Jersey City, N.J. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The priorities right now are all the supplies that would be needed for hospitals, nursing homes, and all of those things,&quot; Mr. Laecca said. &quot;It&apos;s load after load after load coming.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Grocery chains have sought to assure consumers that supply chains for critical goods are still operating without interruption. But workers at warehouses and trucking companies are facing the same concerns as other Americans over the spreading coronavirus, and companies are trying to keep them on the job even as stresses on operations grow. </p>
<p>
     Imperial Dade has an on-site nurse to check workers&apos; temperatures and is handing out protective gear such as gloves and filling spray bottles with sanitizer for delivery drivers, President Jason Tillis said. </p>
<p>
     The company isn&apos;t allowing drivers of inbound trucks on the premises, and its own drivers aren&apos;t helping customers break up freight shipments. At its warehouses, the company spread out lunch shifts and is limiting the number of employees in the break room at any one time. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There&apos;s not really a playbook for this,&quot; Mr. Tillis said. </p>
<p>
     Some logistics hiring has caught fire in an economy that has seen historic job losses this month as many businesses close their doors or sharply scale back. </p>
<p>
     Demand for warehouse workers is &quot;off the charts&quot; in industries such as medical supplies and food and grocery, said Brian Devine, senior vice president of logistics-staffing firm ProLogistix, which works with companies including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. </p>
<p>
     Amazon and Walmart have said they are looking to hire tens of thousands workers for their distribution operations. That means some measure of job safety for distribution and fulfillment workers, but also extra risk, as front-line employees balance economic and health concerns. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Devine said about 27% of workers who responded to a ProLogistix survey the week of March 16 said their workplace hadn&apos;t taken extra precautions against the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>
     E-commerce fulfillment provider ShipBob said it set up coronavirus safety measures at its seven fulfillment centers in early March. That includes handing out masks and gloves to staffers and requiring all visitors, including vendors and drivers, to put on personal protective gear to enter its facilities. </p>
<p>
     Faced with a flood of orders for consumer goods, the company also has reconfigured its warehouse management system to have products like hand sanitizer ship out ahead of items deemed less essential. &quot;We&apos;ve had more volume go out in the last week than any other&quot; outside of the holiday shopping surge between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, said Chief Marketing Officer Casey Armstrong. </p>
<p>
     The company also extended paid sick days for employees and raised pay by $2 an hour, Mr. Armstrong said, a step Amazon and some other companies have taken. </p>
<p>
     E-commerce logistics company Radial has adjusted meetings and shifted break schedules at its fulfillment centers. The company is placing its pack stations further apart and changing the way outbound orders are handled to minimize contact between those who pick goods and those who pack them into boxes, Chief Commercial Officer Tim Hinckley said. </p>
<p>
     XPO Logistics Inc., one of the country&apos;s largest logistics providers, said it is practicing social distancing in its warehouses and has stepped up cleaning regimens of its sites around the U.S. XPO also has instituted paid pandemic sick leave and an employee assistance program that includes coverage for Covid-19 testing and treatment, the Greenwich, Conn.-based company said. </p>
<p>
     Still, high demand for protective gear like gloves and masks is complicating companies&apos; efforts to secure supplies for their workers. </p>
<p>
     Kenco Group, a third-party logistics company based in Chattanooga, Tenn., is &quot;working aggressively to keep supplies flowing to all our sites,&quot; said Chief Operating Officer David Caines. The company&apos;s roughly 100 facilities remain open, although some have been briefly closed for deep cleaning. Equipment gets wiped down at the beginning and ending of each shift. </p>
<p>
     Kenco has enhanced its sick leave policy and relaxed its attendance demands. &quot;But our folks continue to show up and work hard,&quot; Mr. Caines said. &quot;A lot of our employees are the only breadwinners left in their family unit.&quot; </p>

Trump Backs Off New York Quarantine Idea as Global Coronavirus Deaths Top 30,000 -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Stella Yifan Xie and Giovanni Legorano </pre>
<p>
     President Trump sparred with several state governors over how to contain the coronavirus pandemic this weekend, as China further eased restrictions that had locked down its economy and fatalities shot past 30,000 globally. </p>
<p>
     The death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the new virus quintupled over the past two weeks to 31,700 on Sunday, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed. </p>
<p>
     Deaths topped 10,000 in Italy and closed in on 700 in New York City, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     In the U.S., tensions escalated over the suggestion of quarantines. </p>
<p>
     President Trump backed down Saturday evening after earlier saying he might quarantine New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut following a backlash from state leaders. Instead, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a domestic travel advisory cautioning against visits to those areas. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had called the quarantine idea a &quot;federal declaration of war on states&quot; and questioned the legal basis for such measures. Reported cases in New York City topped 30,000, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     The pandemic has taken a toll on the U.S. economy, as millions have lost jobs and the stock market has plunged. </p>
<p>
     The country added more than 19,000 infections by Sunday, pushing the total to over 124,000, as the number of confirmed coronavirus infections world-wide climbed above 678,000, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     Many countries continued to struggle with mask supplies. In the Netherlands, health authorities recalled 600,000 masks which they had recently received from China and distributed to hospitals because they were deemed unsafe, according to Dutch broadcaster NOS. The French government said Saturday that it was organizing airlift operations to collect one billion masks it has ordered from China amid an acute shortage in France. </p>
<p>
     In Italy, the government vowed to transfer EUR400 million ($445.5 million) to local administrations that will be used to distribute vouchers for food and other essential goods to needy people in a bid to head off potential riots. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is the most rapid way we have to reach people in trouble,&quot; Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a televised news conference late Saturday. &quot;These are difficult days. Nobody will be left alone.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Conte warned that lockdown measures will likely be extended, as data aren&apos;t suggesting the spread of the contagion has reached its peak. </p>
<p>
     By Saturday, more than 92,000 people had contracted the virus in Italy, and 10,023 had died. </p>
<p>
     In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro S&#225;nchez said on Saturday that his government would tighten its lockdown measures, by forcing all workers in nonessential sectors to stay at home for two weeks. Authorities in Spain have taken over private hospitals and turned some hotels into makeshift health-care facilities. In Madrid, authorities are transforming a conference center into a 5,500-bed facility. </p>
<p>
     Japan logged 199 new cases Saturday -- its biggest one-day jump -- bringing its total coronavirus infections to 1,724. The latest death toll was 55. </p>
<p>
     Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday warned citizens to prepare for a &quot;long-term battle.&quot; He pledged his government would roll out a stimulus package exceeding the one passed during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. </p>
<p>
     As the epicenter of the pandemic has shifted to the West, Chinese officials have gradually eased the draconian restrictions in central Hubei province that have cut off the flow of goods and people for about two months. </p>
<p>
     The country&apos;s civil aviation regulator reopened domestic flights Sunday in Hubei after weeks of suspension. Flights remain suspended at the province&apos;s largest airport in Wuhan, the city where the world&apos;s first cases were reported late last year and the one worst-hit by China&apos;s Covid-19 outbreak. Flights to and from Wuhan&apos;s Tianhe International Airport will return to service starting April 8. </p>
<p>
     Local authorities in Hubei province, where the death toll is about 3,100, had removed all checkpoints on highways except for in the city of Wuhan as of Friday, said the official Xinhua News Agency. Wuhan&apos;s subway system also resumed operation over the weekend after a two-month suspension. </p>
<p>
     Nearly all of China&apos;s large supermarkets, convenience stores and shopping malls have reopened, Wang Bin, an official with China&apos;s Ministry of Commerce, said Saturday, adding that more than 80% of restaurants and 60% of hotels have resumed business. </p>
<p>
     Yet some major Chinese cities continued to tighten control over international arrivals to get a handle on cases imported from abroad, which could trigger a second wave of infection domestically. </p>
<p>
     The coastal trade hub of Shanghai began imposing 14-day quarantines at designated venues for all inbound travelers starting Saturday, while Guangzhou, another popular destination for international flights to China&apos;s manufacturing heartland, stepped up quarantine rules for arrivals over the weekend. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We must under no circumstances take the battle of epidemic control lightly, and a relaxed mood shall not come too soon,&quot; the official People&apos;s Daily newspaper wrote in a front-page editorial Sunday. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 45 new infections Saturday. Only one, in Henan province, was locally transmitted; the rest were imported from overseas, the commission said. </p>
<p>
     Governments elsewhere in Asia remain vigilant. Some announced plans to unleash stimulus packages to minimize the economic blow from the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday announced a $1.1 billion package to support health services including mental health and domestic violence. The country reported 431 new infections as of Sunday morning, taking its total number above 3,800. </p>
<p>
     New Zealand reported its first death linked to the coronavirus Sunday, while the number of new cases slowed to 63. </p>
<p>
     Singapore&apos;s immigration authority Sunday canceled a citizen&apos;s passport for defying stay-at-home rules. The country reported 70 new cases Saturday -- its second highest one-day jump -- bringing the total to more than 800. </p>

My Family and I Flew Commercial 7 Times In a Covid-19 World. Here&apos;s What We Learned. -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Al Root </pre>
<p>
     In perhaps the worst-timed vacation ever, I took seven commercial flights between March 16 and Wednesday. It was an experience, to say the least. Things changed rapidly at airports and with my chosen airlines over the 10 days. </p>
<p>
     It was a once-in-a-decade splurge, a trip to Hawaii after selling a house. When my family of five -- including two teens and one single-digit child with less attitude -- left New York&apos;s John F. Kennedy International airport, there were fewer than 2,000 Covid-19 cases in the U.S., according to the World Health Organization. </p>
<p>
     Washington state was the hardest-hit region of the country. Things looked OK. In fact, we were told we couldn&apos;t defer the trip by our hotels and resorts. No refunds. So off we went. </p>
<p>
     Preparation </p>
<p>
     We did have concerns. In addition to hotels, we reached out to airlines to inquire about credits and flight deferrals. Airline phone lines were jammed. At one point, after getting to the automated &quot;hold for agent&quot; message -- an accomplishment in and of itself -- the estimated wait time was six hours. </p>
<p>
     Airlines, by March 16, were waiving change fees, but I couldn&apos;t change my flights online because I bought the tickets through a travel agent. That&apos;s one thing that might change in a post-coronavirus world. Airlines and agents will have to figure out how to better mesh their systems. </p>
<p>
     The Two Flights to Hawaii </p>
<p>
     My pre-trip preparation -- or lack of preparation -- meant we were on our original flights. My family didn&apos;t wear masks, but did put on nitrile gloves. They are a helpful reminder to avoid touching your mouth and nose. </p>
<p>
     Foot traffic inside the airport was lighter than usual, and there were a smattering of masks and gloves, but we were in the minority. </p>
<p>
     After boarding, my wife -- the smart one -- insisted we clean every surface to be touched with disinfecting wipes: arm rests, tray tables, entertainment screens, and seat pockets. That generated groans from the children and some strange looks from passengers and crew. </p>
<p>
     Flight attendants assured all travelers that the plane had been cleaned and the aircraft took off about half full. </p>
<p>
     Hand sanitizer was available at the airports on both outbound flights. And sanitizer stations became more prevalent as the vacation progressed. Masks and gloves appeared more often as the airports and planes became emptier. </p>
<p>
     Intra-Vacation, Three Flights </p>
<p>
     Airport social distancing became a thing, too. Families -- including mine -- clustered together, trying to stay six or eight feet away from the next group. </p>
<p>
     No one crowded the ticket scanner or jet bridge, either. This was very pleasant. There was, of course, no risk of overhead bin space running low. As travelers return, people rushing to snag a spot for their bags may strain social distancing, but personal space will likely stay at a premium for a while. People may feel that peace of mind is worth the risk of having to check their carry-ons at the gate. </p>
<p>
     The intra-vacation flights were shorter, which also meant in-flight service was restricted to almost nothing. Only water. Airlines appear to be making a decision -- for the health of their workers -- to minimize physical interactions with travelers. </p>
<p>
     Homeward Bound, Two Flights </p>
<p>
     That became more apparent as we headed for Connecticut on the last two legs of our journey. Service was restricted again, with several gate announcements advising people to bring food onto the plane. Alcohol wasn&apos;t offered or sold. </p>
<p>
     At this point, the majority of travelers were wearing masks and gloves. No one gave us a second look when we wiped down all the surfaces at our seats. This I could see continuing into the future. </p>
<p>
     Our final plane left for home about one-third full. When we arrived home there were more than 60,000 confirmed Covid-10 cases. As of Friday evening, Johns Hopkins reports the U.S. has more than 97,000 confirmed cases. Things have escalated quickly. </p>
<p>
     Future Flights </p>
<p>
     Security, it might go without saying, was a breeze the entire trip. Far fewer people were traveling. That likely won&apos;t stay the same, but there should be some changes designed to maintain distance and smooth the security process, such as new equipment -- in use at one of our airports -- that allowed laptops to stay in bags and shoes to stay on. It was a far cleaner, simpler process. </p>
<p>
     Airlines are now sending emails about attempts to maintain social distancing. American Airlines (ticker: AAL) sent a notice explaining how it was blocking out middle seats on some flights. Space may not always allow it, but it&apos;s a good idea when possible because Covid-like concerns will be with travelers for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>
     In the end, our vacation was cut short by about 12 hours because one of our original return flights was canceled. The change fee, of course, was waived, and we managed a much more convenient route home -- changing multiple airports -- for a tiny increased charge. </p>
<p>
     Ideally, that is another thing that will stick around -- easier changes for passengers. Flexibility is great and, for now, required for anyone trying to navigate commercial air travel. </p>
<p>
     I have to feel for the airlines. The stocks have rallied about 31% on average over the past week. The president has signed a Covid-19 stimulus bill with money earmarked for air carriers. That helped the sector. </p>
<p>
     Still, airline stocks are off about 50% year to date, worse than the comparable drops of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500. There remains a lot for investors -- and travelers -- to figure out about how the industry will evolve in response to Covid-19. </p>

The Class of 2020 Was Headed Into a Hot Job Market. Then Coronavirus Hit.</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Kathryn Dill and Patrick Thomas </pre>
<p>
     Marie Chailosky is graduating this spring from Ohio University with a bachelor&apos;s degree in journalism. She had plans to intern this summer in Nashville at Warner Music Group Corp.&apos;s radio streaming department. Thursday, that offered evaporated. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Chailosky, 22 years old, says several classmates have had job offers pulled amid the economic chaos borne from the new coronavirus. She was also laid off from her hostess job at a brew pub in Athens, Ohio, and with her internship falling through, she says she plans on staying at her parent&apos;s home in Florida for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I&apos;m really not sure what&apos;s in store for me,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     A Warner Music spokesman said, &quot;While many of our offices work from home, we&apos;ve temporarily paused our intake, with a view to resuming in the fall semester.&quot; </p>
<p>
     A month ago, college seniors across America were preparing to graduate into the hottest job market in decades. Now, graduation ceremonies scheduled for May are canceled, three million people have filed for unemployment as businesses shutter to stop the spread of disease and many of the soon-to-be degree holders who don&apos;t yet have jobs are wondering whether they should even bother looking. </p>
<p>
     Stacey Moynahan, an assistant dean of undergraduate programs and business school career service at Chapman University in California, is counseling students not to hold out for their dream job. &quot;There are going to be opportunities that surface. They may not look like you thought they were going to look. This is not the time to stop your search, or stop networking.&quot; </p>
<p>
     As students were ordered off campuses in recent days and began logging into virtual coursework to finish the semester, internet message boards filled with questions and rumors about bumped start dates and rescinded offers, capturing the growing anxiety among even the most well-positioned new hires. </p>
<p>
     Major accounting and consulting firms together hire tens of thousands of newly minted graduates every year through a fall recruiting process that can make many seniors&apos; spring semester a worry-free one. Company spokespeople for Ernst &amp; Young, Accenture PLC,  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and KPMG LLP confirmed that the employers plan to honor offer letters already extended to graduating seniors for 2020. </p>
<p>
     The campus recruiting team at Jefferies Group LLC, a financial-services firm, contacted its summer intern class and universities to say that the summer internship program might require some adjustments, but no offers are in jeopardy. </p>
<p>
     Erika Hanlan, a career adviser at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Mass., said there have been disruptions to the co-op programs many students participate in throughout the year in paid roles that often lead to permanent job opportunities. Walt Disney Co. ended one student&apos;s co-op experience early, and Southwest Airlines Co. paused its internship and co-op opportunities, she says. One student Ms. Hanlan advises who had secured a job offer in the fall had it rescinded earlier this month. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Finance, consulting, accounting -- a lot of those already did the bulk of their hires in the fall,&quot; says Christine Cruzvergara, vice president of Higher Education &amp; Student Success at Handshake, a job-search tool for college students. But students pursuing roles in other industries, including advertising, public relations, education and creative fields, are more likely to be starting their job search now, she says. </p>
<p>
     Graduating into a recession can have a lasting impact. College grads who entered the job market during the recession of the early 1980s had, 15 years after graduation, wages that were 2.5% lower than graduates who didn&apos;t start out in a downturn, according to research by Lisa Kahn, a University of Rochester economist. </p>
<p>
     Employers and campus advisers alike are stressing that it is too soon to know exactly how the coronavirus pandemic will change new grads&apos; prospects. Paul Solomon, founder of Wall Street recruiting firm Solo Management, says that health care and biotech students are well poised to enter the current workforce in great demand, while hospitality, business and finance grads may face a steeper climb. </p>
<p>
     Christian Williams, 21, is a senior at the University of North Carolina double majoring in economics and Russian. The Nashville native says he has been looking for a role in equity research or financial planning since the fall and was hoping something would pan out from the many on-campus job fairs and other recruiting events scheduled for the spring. Those events have been canceled or moved online, he says. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I feel like I worked my butt off through college to get a job and it&apos;s frustrating.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Olivia vonNieda, who is graduating from Harvard Business School in May, was planning to launch a cold-brew coffee device after graduation, but says no one is making the parts she needs right now. So she says she is considering a return to the health-care industry, where she worked as a forecaster for a pharmaceutical company that makes a cancer drug before she went back to business school. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s so unprecedented,&quot; she says of the upended economy. &quot;We&apos;re making a premium product so that kind of depends on people having disposable income for a nice coffee machine.&quot; </p>
<p>
     William Botto, 22, is a senior at Champlain College in Burlington, Vt., majoring in computer science and digital forensics. He has had cybersecurity internships every year of college and secured an offer from a global tech company in February, after initial interviews with a campus recruiter. As far as he knows, his offer and August start date are still valid. </p>
<p>
     He has had less luck finding an internship for this summer, and says that many posts on job sites now click through to expired listings. Job security is touted to students as a major selling point of studying cybersecurity, he says, adding that he worries that may change just as he and his classmates enter the workforce. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Now more than ever,&quot; he says, &quot;I have to think, do I still have job security?&quot; </p>

What the Coronavirus Means for Bacardi&apos;s Marketing Strategy -- Journal Report</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jennifer Maloney </pre>
<p>
     Before the coronavirus outbreak, Bacardi Ltd. Chief Executive Mahesh Madhavan was grappling with a fundamental problem for the spirits industry: A new generation of consumers was drinking far less than their parents did </p>
<p>
     Now he&apos;s facing another challenge. A pandemic has closed bars and restaurants around the world, prompting a rise in online alcohol purchases and worries that consumer behavior may be forever changed. For now, though, Mr. Madhavan is forging ahead with strategies Bacardi put in place before the crisis. Among other things, it&apos;s looking to improved marketing, lower-alcohol cocktails and new experiments to make drinking at home more convenient. </p>
<p>
     He has some unusually relevant experience in catering to a generation that isn&apos;t as enamored of alcohol: Earlier in his career, as a spirits executive in Thailand, Mr. Madhavan took a break from drinking alcohol. He had gone through an intense period of building relationships with customers by partaking in the local culture of drinking late into the night. Then, wanting to spend more time with his small children, he gave it up. Although he drinks now, he says he is much more mindful about how much alcohol he consumes. </p>
<p>
     In this edited interview, Mr. Madhavan talks about his plans for Bacardi during the pandemic -- and after. </p>
<p>
     Boosting share </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Bacardi&apos;s U.S. and global share had been falling for several years, but recently has begun to turn around. Could you talk about that dip and what you&apos;ve been doing about it? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Some of our core brands weren&apos;t doing very well, and part of it was to do with the fact that we weren&apos;t consistent in our messaging with consumers. Bacardi changed its positioning practically every year between 2001 and 2017, and the brand really didn&apos;t stand for anything with the consumer. Since 2017, what we have said is that we will remain consistent in terms of our brand messaging, and we have started to do that. We put more money behind advertising. We are also seeing more innovation coming into the pipeline. On the back of that, we have seen all these core brands coming back to growth again. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What does the coronavirus outbreak mean for that strategy? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: For quarter one, we have cut back on our spends that are consumer-facing. Europe was [gearing up for] summer. You had a lot of festivals, and if you go around Europe, people like to sit outside, watch people. That is not going to happen in quarter one. What we are doing is putting some of that money toward reaching out to people within the digital space. So, getting more people on Instagram, on Facebook on YouTube through some of the communications that we have. </p>
<p>
     We were working with e-commerce sites in Europe and the U.S. before, but we are seeing even more [online purchases] now that people are calling for groceries to be delivered home, including ingredients for cocktails. If you want to make eight margaritas, they give you the ingredients for eight margaritas delivered to your doorstep. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What impact has the coronavirus outbreak had on your sales? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Initially, it was impacting us more in places like China and global travel retail, and since our businesses weren&apos;t very large in China, it didn&apos;t have such an impact. In a lot of airports, essentially the stores were closed. People were traveling but they weren&apos;t visiting stores to buy goods, and we could see that in January and February. </p>
<p>
     In March, we&apos;ve seen a larger hit in Western Europe. In the U.S., you&apos;re seeing a huge spike in the sales in the liquor stores, the grocery stores, Kroger, Costco, those kinds of outlets. People were stocking up in anticipation of the long term. You&apos;re seeing similar trends around the globe. While restaurants have closed down, the grocers, the liquor stores are seeing huge spikes in sales. </p>
<p>
     The global percentage of our sales coming from liquor stores, grocers, large formatted stores is in the region of 75%. Then the balance comes from restaurants, bars, pubs, etc. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Do you think it will balance out, or will you see a net drop? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: I think we will see a slight drop. The unknown is, how long is this going to continue? If it is three months, we are prepared for it. If it goes six months to a year, we&apos;ll have to re-evaluate our strategies. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Many other spirits have premiumization, with consumers willing to spend more for higher-quality spirits. Rum is late to that party. Why? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: When you look at categories like scotch, they had to come from Scotland, tequila had to come from Mexico. </p>
<p>
     When you look at rum, you had rum in the Philippines, in India, in the Caribbean. Nobody defined what rum should be. Therefore, you had rum being produced as a cheap spirit, catering to the masses. Now people are putting a lot more emphasis on source. </p>
<p>
     You are seeing consumers saying, &quot;I like my rum coming from the Caribbean.&quot; Therefore, you are seeing a shift toward people willing to pay more money at the premium end. </p>
<p>
     About two years back, we launched our dark rums -- Bacardi 4, Bacardi 8, Bacardi 10 -- and we just launched Bacardi 16. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Since the coronavirus outbreak, is the premiumization trend continuing? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Absolutely. In the U.S., people are moving to very cheap products or to very expensive products. The midprice products are getting a beating. People who are wanting to save for a rainy day are saying, &quot;I will downgrade,&quot; but a lot of people sitting at home are saying, &quot;Let me treat myself to the best cocktail, or a nice bottle of wine and enjoy that with the family.&quot; </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Younger people drink less than their parents and grandparents. What does that mean for Bacardi and for the spirits industry? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Ten years, 20 years back, when you looked at the spirits industry, you had the youth drinking to get drunk. We don&apos;t see that anymore. You are seeing people being in control. They want to have drinks that provide them with the taste, but they&apos;re very conscious about the calories. Therefore, you&apos;re seeing the rise of things like vermouth, like spritz. </p>
<p>
     We&apos;ve just launched a brand called Martini 0.0, and it&apos;s a sparkling wine. It&apos;s exactly the same-tasting product, but it has zero alcohol, and we&apos;re having that tested out in places like Saudi Arabia and South Africa and the Philippines, to learn more from consumers before we take it globally. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: So, the spirits industry in the future, is it making a whole bunch of nonalcoholic beverages? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: You&apos;re going to see a certain portion of spirits going into low or no alcohol. We&apos;re also seeing a trend of consumers wanting to drink better and drink more premium. They&apos;re saying, &quot;I&apos;m conscious about what I put in my body, I&apos;m very conscious about the calories, and therefore, when I drink, I want to make sure I really drink the best.&quot; It augurs very well for Bacardi, because we have a premium and a superpremium portfolio. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Beer companies now are diversifying. Anheuser-Busch is selling canned cocktails, canned wine, ice tea and bottled water. Molson Coors wants to sell coffee and tea and kombucha. Are spirits companies going to have to diversify in a similar way? Are you going to have to start selling hard seltzer, which is essentially a beer product? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: You had spirit companies doing this long before the beer guys caught up with it, and I certainly see the spirit companies coming back with products and drinks that are in the same area of basically being healthy, being flavorful, using natural ingredients, being low in alcohol, being tasty and flavorful, and it can be done with a spirit product, too. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What&apos;s your take on at-home cocktail machines? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: It&apos;s an idea we worked on in 2010, and then we shelved it. We felt it was cumbersome for a consumer to buy another machine. It takes a lot of money in terms of investment, and you are then limited to that choice of what that machine can do. </p>
<p>
     Having said that, we are very excited about something we have in our pipeline. It&apos;s about making a cocktail at home in an accessible way, where you don&apos;t need a machine, but at the same time, you have the ability to deliver a consistent, great-tasting cocktail to drink with your family and your friends at home. Unfortunately, we are not ready with it. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Have you seen similar trends in markets overseas that you see in the U.S., in terms of younger people drinking less and more thoughtfully? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Thirteen years back, if you went across the world, you would see a lot of our spirit brands being consumed in nightclubs, high energy, high music. That is on the decrease. What we have seen more is restaurants, bars that provide an all-around experience. So, having a Michelin Star chef, getting great cocktails with the food, and engaging consumers and telling them about the process of the cooking or the art of making cocktails -- consumers are willing to pay for that. </p>
<p>
     Cautious times </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Is behavior going to change in the long run? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Having seen SARS and several other similar issues in Asia, I certainly believe that in the short run, people will be wary and not go out. But in the long run, the human being is great at forgetting the past. It&apos;s a part of healing. I have no doubt you will see music festivals come back. You will see people going back to restaurants and dining. You&apos;ll see people going back to bars. In fact, we believe that when things open up, people are going to party so hard like we&apos;ve never seen before. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: In the meantime, though, as people are cloistered, has your messaging shifted toward making cocktails at home? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: In Southeast Asia, we have started to repurpose our advocacy staff, professional mixologists who go out to train bartenders. We are using that to train bartenders online. We are also starting to have sessions where we can train consumers [online] in terms of how to build a cocktail. </p>

What the Coronavirus Means for Bacardi&apos;s -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     We are also giving a few bartenders around the world a thousand dollars to make a short video helping consumers understand how to make a simple cocktail by using some of the ingredients at home. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What do you make of the coronavirus-era trend of virtual happy hours? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Typically, on Friday evening in Bermuda, we open the bar at about 4:30 for all employees. They&apos;re allowed to bring in one or two of their friends or family. We didn&apos;t want to break that. We said, &quot;Guess what, at 4:30 we will have a virtual happy hour with employees.&quot; For the first one, I think we had about 25 people signing in through Microsoft Teams, talking about their experience that week. It was a fun get-together virtually, where people had the ability to express what they were feeling. </p>
<p>
     I think that&apos;s really important at this time when people are quarantining themselves, just having that ability to see somebody on that screen that you can connect with. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Will the rise in e-commerce last beyond the current crisis? Will people get used to the convenience of having liquor or cocktail ingredients delivered to their homes? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: I think it is definitely going to be a habit that will stay, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to completely replace the fact that people like to walk around the store, touch and feel different products, read the back labels and ingredients of different products. That will always happen. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: You practice mindful drinking. What does that mean to you, and how do you do it? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Nowadays what I do is I just reverse some of the proportions of the drinks. So, if I would have a martini, I would make sure that I have more of the vermouth and less of the Bombay, or less of the gin. For me, it&apos;s all about being watchful of what you take in. You just want to make sure that you enjoy the evening and you&apos;re in control. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: If you didn&apos;t work in the spirits business, would you be happy not drinking alcohol at all? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Even before I joined the spirits business, I&apos;ve always enjoyed a cocktail. I can see myself, even when I&apos;m 80, enjoying a drink every day. You need to make sure you have that balance in life, and it&apos;s about savoring the drink. It&apos;s enjoying that moment and celebrating that moment of life, with the loved ones that you have next to you. I always say, life is about enjoying moments that matter, and when you bring family or friends together, if you have a cocktail which allows you to have those engaging conversations, why not? </p>

How the Navy Revamped Boot Camp -- Journal Report</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Lauren Weber </pre>
<p>
     Great Lakes, Ill. -- Four nights a week, young people arrive by the busload at the Navy&apos;s Recruit Training Command in this town north of Chicago. As they file off the bus at dusk, they are greeted by shouted commands: &quot;Run, female! Run, male! Move your ass! You will not move this slow again for the next eight weeks!&quot; </p>
<p>
     They&apos;ll stay awake for 24 hours, being outfitted with uniforms and sized for shoes, taking urine tests and receiving vaccinations. Men&apos;s heads will be shaved. They&apos;ll all learn how to respond to orders, address superiors and carry themselves like sailors. </p>
<p>
     These eight weeks look dramatically different today than they did three years ago. </p>
<p>
     Discussions about reforming boot camp began in 2016, but they picked up urgency following a pair of deadly collisions at sea in 2017. The Navy has since overhauled the training that transforms civilians into sailors. The accidents revealed a military culture that had lapsed into complacency and normalized reckless levels of risk, according to Navy investigators -- so the service has gone back to basics, cutting down on classroom learning while beefing up hands-on training in seamanship and responding to emergencies. </p>
<p>
     The service is also scrapping some old ideas about the Navy&apos;s culture. Among other things, it is moving past a &quot;tough it out&quot; mentality -- which may have led to excessive risk-taking -- to a system based on helping trainees focus and stay resilient in the face of challenges and crises. It is also raising the bar for recruits to pass, leading to higher attrition but better-prepared sailors. And it is aiming to deliver continuous training to personnel over the course of their careers to keep their skills sharp. </p>
<p>
     The deep end </p>
<p>
     The Navy&apos;s efforts may not look like typical corporate training -- especially at the massive boot camp, where more than 40,000 recruits arrive annually in waves of up to 900 a week. Few corporations keep new employees awake for 24 hours after they show up, or yell at them the moment they arrive or shave their heads. </p>
<p>
     Still, the military has long been a source of inspiration and fascination for business leaders, and at its best the service manifests qualities executives try to foster in their organizations: dedication to a mission and rigorous discipline. What&apos;s more, the armed forces -- with more than 1.3 million active-duty service members and hundreds of thousands of reservists and civilian employees -- struggle with many of the same challenges private-sector employers face, including overbearing bureaucracy, resistance to change, cultural drift and leadership upheaval. Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, for instance, was fired last year during a conflict with the White House over the disciplining of a Navy SEAL. </p>
<p>
     In this case, the Navy&apos;s boot-camp initiative offers lessons for companies in how to put their practices under a microscope, recognize when big changes are needed, and then make the often difficult adjustments. There are few companies that wouldn&apos;t benefit, for instance, from making their training both more relevant and effective. For the Navy, as for many employers, the motivation to act only gathered urgency in the face of catastrophe. </p>
<p>
     At the Department of Defense, the largest employer in the U.S., training its workforce and maintaining its culture is a matter of life and death. In 2017, 17 sailors died in collisions involving the U.S.S. Fitzgerald and, two months later, the U.S.S. John S. McCain. The incidents left the service and its sailors reeling, unable to avoid the conclusion that something had gone terribly wrong in the Navy&apos;s operations. </p>
<p>
     In the case of the Navy, congressional investigators and military officers had warned repeatedly of overworked sailors, inadequate training and budget cuts in the years leading up to the two collisions, due largely to an overcommitment of Navy ships to overseas missions. </p>
<p>
     Those warnings were mostly ignored by Navy leaders. In September 2017, the Government Accountability Office noted that it had made 11 recommendations in prior years related to the Navy&apos;s readiness, and only one had been implemented. </p>
<p>
     In its favor, the military has a tradition of evaluation and self-correction, says Mr. Collins. &quot;They&apos;re very open about learning from things,&quot; he says. &quot;It goes back to the gravity of the mission and the fact of what&apos;s at stake.&quot; After missions, battles and significant incidents, officers debrief participants and analyze events closely. </p>
<p>
     In this case, it took 17 casualties to force a grim reckoning. </p>
<p>
     A report written by Navy officials soon after the 2017 collisions offered an unstinting appraisal of what had gone wrong. The 33-member review team determined that the incidents were preventable and faulted, among other things, failures in training sailors in the fundamental skills of seamanship. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re not even training them to be sailors&quot; was a refrain that U.S.-based officers were hearing from counterparts commanding ships in the fleet, according to several officers and senior enlistees. </p>
<p>
     Reps and sets </p>
<p>
     The Navy is now focusing hard on basics. Officers and administrators have rewritten 60% of boot camp&apos;s two-month curriculum, tightening standards and emphasizing fundamentals like firefighting, damage control such as plugging leaks and day-to-day equipment repairs, and standing watch. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you can&apos;t fight a fire, you&apos;re not going to be a sailor,&quot; says Rear Adm. Jamie Sands, the Navy SEAL who was tapped in spring 2019 to command several training programs, including boot camp. &quot;We&apos;ll remediate you, we&apos;ll try to get you there, but if you can&apos;t get there, you can&apos;t be a sailor.&quot; Adm. Sands keeps a copy of the Navy&apos;s report on his desk at all times to remind him that when the service sends poorly trained sailors out to sea, lives are lost. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This isn&apos;t summer camp,&quot; says Tanya Mojica, a boatswain&apos;s mate, a few days after graduating from boot camp in August. &quot;This is your life.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The single biggest change the Navy has made to boot camp is immersing recruits in experiential learning to simulate, as closely as possible, conditions aboard a ship in times of peace or war. Recruits now receive 177 hours of hands-on learning during their eight weeks, up from 160 hours in 2017. Classroom instruction fell, as elements were removed, condensed or pushed to subsequent training periods. </p>
<p>
     In each of the 13 barracks that house recruits at Great Lakes, &quot;we literally tore out computer labs, removed all the desks and turned them into ship decks to practice basic war-fighting competencies,&quot; says Adm. Sands. </p>
<p>
     Commanders, who lead boot-camp divisions of around 88 recruits and are responsible for their performance, now assess their divisions&apos; weaknesses and use blocks of time once devoted to online learning to have their recruits drill skills like patching pipes or tying knots to anchor and moor a ship. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Think of a pitcher who throws thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of pitches, so he knows the precise feel, the precise hand movements of a good pitch. That&apos;s what we&apos;re trying to do now,&quot; says Rear Adm. Kyle Cozad, who oversees all education and training for the Navy. &quot;We&apos;re doing reps and sets to develop muscle memory.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;The assumption is that there&apos;s complexity to these tasks, so you will probably have multiple cycles of failure on your way to success,&quot; says Elliott Masie, a training-and-development expert who has visited boot camp at Great Lakes and once brought a delegation of leaders from firms like Accenture, Walmart and McDonald&apos;s to observe the Navy&apos;s training methods. &quot;They don&apos;t just tolerate it; they structure in failure.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Recruits spend two days inside the U.S.S. Marlinspike, a facility at Great Lakes containing a life-size replica of the deck of a surface ship and a classroom outfitted with ropes and bollards, the posts to which ships are tied. There, recruits practice tying lines, relaying orders, getting a ship under way and bringing it back to port. The only thing missing is water. </p>
<p>
     During practice on the replica, instructors ring a bell every time recruits make a mistake. Each bell signals an error that could result in a sailor tumbling overboard in a real-life situation, says William Haines, a gunner&apos;s mate who attended boot camp last summer. </p>
<p>
     When his division first attempted the exercise of bringing a ship to port, the bell rang 27 times, he says, and the division blew its allotted 25-minute deadline. After that, &quot;we promised our instructor we would do it in under 20 minutes, with no safety strikes. And we did,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>
     To graduate, recruits must pass an all-night test called &quot;battle stations,&quot; proving their skills in an environment designed to look and feel like the deck and hull of a warship. As water floods through a burst pipe, they must identify and repair the leak and move boxes of ammunition to dry storage. In another area, an explosion is followed by smoke and alarms; dummies stand in for sailors with injuries, some fatal. The recruits put out fires and extract the wounded. </p>
<p>
     Battle stations used to be more of an exercise with coaching from instructors; it is now an evaluation of skills, and failure just before the finish line isn&apos;t uncommon, officers say. On rare occasions, commanders fail entire divisions if recruits don&apos;t display teamwork. Some who fail get one chance to retake the test with another division; others are discharged. </p>
<p>
     Pause and refocus </p>
<p>
     The Navy has also begun to see the limits of its longtime &quot;tough it out&quot; approach. Boot camp is still a crucible, and it is designed accordingly. Recruits are yelled at, insulted, broken down. Between 10% and 12% drop out before graduation; the attrition rate has increased 3 percentage points since the boot-camp changes were implemented. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We shock them into the military lifestyle,&quot; says Chief Petty Officer Daniel Rainmaker, who was formerly part of the team that initiates new recruits on their first night. &quot;Many of them have never been yelled at in their lives.&quot; </p>

How the Navy Revamped Boot Camp -- Journal Report -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     But the Navy is redefining toughness in the wake of the deadly accidents. One explanation for the incidents was that officers pushed to follow orders, and didn&apos;t question bad decisions, even though they didn&apos;t have enough resources to do what they were told. </p>
<p>
     So, the Navy is absorbing research about resilience and mindfulness and folding that into a program called Warrior Toughness, which was implemented in the summer of 2018 and is now integrated into nearly every aspect of boot camp. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve all been told in the past to suck it up and push through,&quot; says Senior Chief Petty Officer Warren Caverly, who previously ran the gym where recruits do daily fitness drills and tests. Recruits are taught to mentally and physically recalibrate -- pause and refocus -- if they are struggling, and encouraged to talk about problems they are having. </p>
<p>
     All boot camp officers, instructors and recruit division commanders -- the chiefs who oversee recruits as they make their way through boot camp -- attend five 90-minute classes taught by psychologists, chaplains and service members who work in high-pressure environments, such as technicians who dispose of sea mines, torpedoes and other explosives. </p>
<p>
     Warrior toughness &quot;is like hitting control-alt-delete on a computer,&quot; Mr. Caverly says. </p>
<p>
     The Navy is trying to fine-tune the program&apos;s balance of stress and support. Boot camp &quot;is a combination of a supportive environment, a challenging environment and a tough-love environment,&quot; says Mr. Masie. &quot;There are very few corporations that do that as holistically as they do.&quot; </p>
<p>
     At the Olympic-size swimming pool at Great Lakes, all recruits must pass a test showing they can jump off a 10-foot-high platform, swim a full length of the pool, float on their stomachs for five minutes, and turn their uniforms into flotation devices. Some of them cannot swim and have never been in a pool. </p>
<p>
     It is a test recruits have done for some time. Now, though, before the test, an instructor reads a Warrior Toughness briefing that involves visualizing the exercise and doing deep breathing. &quot;Feel the ground beneath your feet. You climb the ladder confidently and deliberately.... When you get to the top, you smell the chlorine. You see yourself stepping willingly over the platform.... Feel the sensation of your body rising to the surface with ease.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Does it work? As in the past, some recruits panic when they hit the water, come up gasping for air and are pulled to the side by instructors wielding long poles. Many can&apos;t complete the full length and are sent to a smaller pool for remedial classes -- and, as before, they are allowed to take the test multiple times. </p>
<p>
     In previous years, says Capt. Erik Thors, who oversees boot camp, 1.6% of recruits were &quot;swim failures.&quot; That number has dropped to 0.4%. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Statistically, we see better physical-fitness scores, more push-ups, faster run scores,&quot; he says. &quot;Warrior Toughness taps into the mental block and helps people realize they can do a heck of a lot more than they thought.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For now, Warrior Toughness is confined to boot camp, but the Navy plans to introduce it to the fleet. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We want to affect the dynamic of the Navy from the bottom up,&quot; Capt. Thors says. &quot;With 40,000 sailors leaving here every year, we&apos;ll change the fabric of one-third of the Navy within three years.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Still, it is unclear what impact Warrior Toughness and the refocus on hands-on learning are having so far. Adm. Sands and others at Great Lakes say they are hearing anecdotally from officers in the fleet that sailors are arriving on ships with a stronger set of skills. But it may take years to develop a more comprehensive view on the changes&apos; impact. </p>
<p>
     The Government Accountability Office recently reviewed changes made to the Navy&apos;s training for surface warfare officers, high-ranking sailors who drive ships, lead crews and are responsible for ship safety and operations, in the wake of the 2017 crashes. According to the GAO&apos;s November 2019 report, senior Navy officials estimated it would take 16 years to determine whether those changes had been effective. The agency also said the service had not put in place effective methods for evaluating the impact of those adjustments, suggesting the Navy still needs to figure out how to track its progress.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ready, Relevant Learning </p>
<p>
     The Navy isn&apos;t just thinking about training at boot camp. Its officers, like many company managers, are talking about lifelong learning -- a contrast to the service&apos;s longtime &quot;one and done&quot; attitude toward training. Sailors received follow-up training as they progressed through their trades, but the Navy got complacent about assessing proficiency and refreshing people&apos;s skills as equipment was modernized or missions changed, Adm. Cozad says. For example, congressional investigators found that, as of June 2017, 37% of skill certifications for some crews based in Japan had expired, a fivefold increase from two years earlier. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We used to take a sailor from boot camp, and plug them into a training system focused on everything they would need in a 10- to 20-year career, &quot; he says. &quot;But not every sailor will stay in for 20 years, so some training was never realized. We also zeroed in on the fact that training has a shelf life.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;The speed of mission change is faster than ever,&quot; says Mr. Masie. The military is &quot;needing to now train in a way that they can get pretty radically and quickly uptrained, retrained and augmented as things change.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Navy is slowly integrating an approach called Ready, Relevant Learning, designed as a &quot;continuum that allows us to target the right skills at the right time and the right place,&quot; says Adm. Cozad. Most sailors get specialized training right after boot camp, and depending on one&apos;s rating, or occupation, there is usually follow-up training in the setting that makes the most sense, such as on board ships or at a base. </p>
<p>
     The Navy is revising its training methods for more than 75% of its approximately 80 occupations, beginning with operations specialist -- which Naval investigators called out for training deficiencies that contributed to the 2017 collisions. </p>
<p>
     Operations specialists operate radar, navigation and communication equipment on ships, detecting and tracking nearby ships, aircraft and other objects. </p>
<p>
     The Navy&apos;s review team found that operations specialists were unprepared to manage ships&apos; navigation systems and operate surface radars to monitor what was happening in the waters around ships. Their training also hadn&apos;t been updated regularly to include information about new consoles and technology used to steer. </p>
<p>
     The material and the delivery methods at post-boot camp training for operations specialists have been modernized away from rote memorization to practical application, says Lt. J. Ray Norris, who runs the school at Great Lakes where new graduates get their first specialized training for the rating, known as the &quot;A,&quot; or Accession, school. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It would be like, &apos;Look at this, hold it in your memory until we test you on it on Friday.&apos; They data dumped as soon as they left here,&quot; he says. Now, 80% of the curriculum is hands-on work with simulations and interactive courseware and 20% is lectures, with more engaging lessons built around scenarios experienced in the fleet. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We all hear, this generation really loves computers,&quot; says Capt. David Dwyer, who oversees the post-boot camp training at Great Lakes. &quot;Well, they like to play games. They still don&apos;t like computer-based training.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Post-boot camp training now is more self-paced and interactive. &quot;We went from 1970s-style teaching to 2019,&quot; says Lt. Norris. The program was piloted in April, and the first class that used it graduated in May. Full implementation took place in September. Now, the goal is, sailors won&apos;t need to relearn the basics when they arrive on their ships. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re taking 18-year-olds that don&apos;t know anything about being an operations specialist, the most vital job on the ship, and in 34 days we&apos;re sending them to a destroyer,&quot; says Lt. Norris. &quot;And probably within a month of getting there, they&apos;re qualified, proficient, making recommendations to a captain during a mission.&quot; </p>
<p>
     That is no small thing. A number of reports even before the 2017 collisions had faulted the Navy for understaffing ships and overworking sailors, leading to fatigue and burnout. The understaffing stems from earlier decisions, debated fiercely inside the service, to prioritize building new ships and maintaining a heavy load of missions despite cuts to the workforce. The Navy is rethinking that approach, but major changes haven&apos;t happened. </p>
<p>
     On the ships, sailors can only take a full load of responsibilities once they are qualified, a process that can involve oral and written tests, as well as senior sailors signing off on a list of competencies. The Navy hopes its improved training will speed up that process. </p>
<p>
     It also hopes that the tighter focus on standards, resilience and fundamentals will help the service avoid collisions like those back in 2017. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We had a little cultural drift of &apos;that can never happen to me. Maybe I won&apos;t have to fight a fire on a ship,&apos; &quot; says Adm. Sands. That attitude led to complacency, he says. &quot;When you take ownership of the problem, you can start to address it,&quot; he adds. </p>

Stimulus Package Brings Relief to Most Student-Loan Borrowers</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Josh Mitchell </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- The economic-stimulus package signed by President Trump on Friday offers relief for most of the 43 million Americans who owe a total of $1.5 trillion in federal student debt. </p>
<p>
     The bill allows most borrowers to stop making monthly payments through Sept. 30, with no financial penalties. Interest will be suspended, so each borrower&apos;s balance will freeze, and the account will remain in good standing. </p>
<p>
     The bill covers student loans made directly by the federal government and a portion of those made by private lenders and guaranteed by the government under a program that ended in 2010. However, loans made under the federal guarantee program that are held by commercial institutions won&apos;t qualify. </p>
<p>
     The typical family spends $179 a month on payments, according to a July 2019 report by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. The Institute for College Access and Success, a student advocacy group, estimates that the suspension of payments will free up some $50 billion for families over roughly six months. </p>
<p>
     The bill goes further than a policy that President Trump announced earlier this month to allow borrowers to suspend payments for two months, interest-free. Administration officials said federal law empowered the administration to make the change without congressional approval, but some education experts, such as a financial-aid consultant Mark Kantrowitz, questioned the administration&apos;s legal authority. </p>
<p>
     Congressional Democrats had pushed unsuccessfully for a provision in the stimulus bill to reduce each federal borrower&apos;s balance by at least $10,000 while suspending payments. </p>
<p>
     In one sense, the bill forgives a portion of debt for some borrowers. The roughly six months of foregone payments would count as on-time payments for borrowers enrolled in programs that forgive debt after a period. </p>
<p>
     For example, government and nonprofit workers hoping to take advantage of a program called &quot;public service loan forgiveness&quot; must make 120 monthly payments before balances are forgiven. The six months of nonpayments under the stimulus bill would count toward those 120 payments. </p>
<p>
     The stimulus bill also provides a temporary incentive for employers to pay down their workers&apos; student-loan balances. Employers would be able to contribute up to $5,250 toward each worker&apos;s student debt through Dec. 31 without any tax consequences for the employee. That would in effect give the employee a tax-free raise, because normally such contributions would be treated as taxable income. </p>
<p>
     Supporters say that provision will shift some education costs to companies from individuals, freeing up money for families. Critics, including higher-education expert Jason Delisle of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and some progressives, say it would favor higher-paid workers at big companies that offer generous benefits over lower-paid workers at companies that don&apos;t offer them. </p>
<p>
     Few employers offer student-loan assistance, though the number is rising. Eight percent of employers surveyed by the Society for Human Resource Management in April 2019 offered assistance with student loans, up from 4% in 2018 and 3% in 2015. </p>

What the Coronavirus Means for Bacardi&apos;s Marketing Strategy -- Journal Report</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jennifer Maloney </pre>
<p>
     Before the coronavirus outbreak, Bacardi Ltd. Chief Executive Mahesh Madhavan was grappling with a fundamental problem for the spirits industry: A new generation of consumers was drinking far less than their parents did </p>
<p>
     Now he&apos;s facing another challenge. A pandemic has closed bars and restaurants around the world, prompting a rise in online alcohol purchases and worries that consumer behavior may be forever changed. For now, though, Mr. Madhavan is forging ahead with strategies Bacardi put in place before the crisis. Among other things, it&apos;s looking to improved marketing, lower-alcohol cocktails and new experiments to make drinking at home more convenient. </p>
<p>
     He has some unusually relevant experience in catering to a generation that isn&apos;t as enamored of alcohol: Earlier in his career, as a spirits executive in Thailand, Mr. Madhavan took a break from drinking alcohol. He had gone through an intense period of building relationships with customers by partaking in the local culture of drinking late into the night. Then, wanting to spend more time with his small children, he gave it up. Although he drinks now, he says he is much more mindful about how much alcohol he consumes. </p>
<p>
     In this edited interview, Mr. Madhavan talks about his plans for Bacardi during the pandemic -- and after. </p>
<p>
     Boosting share </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Bacardi&apos;s U.S. and global share had been falling for several years, but recently has begun to turn around. Could you talk about that dip and what you&apos;ve been doing about it? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Some of our core brands weren&apos;t doing very well, and part of it was to do with the fact that we weren&apos;t consistent in our messaging with consumers. Bacardi changed its positioning practically every year between 2001 and 2017, and the brand really didn&apos;t stand for anything with the consumer. Since 2017, what we have said is that we will remain consistent in terms of our brand messaging, and we have started to do that. We put more money behind advertising. We are also seeing more innovation coming into the pipeline. On the back of that, we have seen all these core brands coming back to growth again. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What does the coronavirus outbreak mean for that strategy? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: For quarter one, we have cut back on our spends that are consumer-facing. Europe was [gearing up for] summer. You had a lot of festivals, and if you go around Europe, people like to sit outside, watch people. That is not going to happen in quarter one. What we are doing is putting some of that money toward reaching out to people within the digital space. So, getting more people on Instagram, on Facebook on YouTube through some of the communications that we have. </p>
<p>
     We were working with e-commerce sites in Europe and the U.S. before, but we are seeing even more [online purchases] now that people are calling for groceries to be delivered home, including ingredients for cocktails. If you want to make eight margaritas, they give you the ingredients for eight margaritas delivered to your doorstep. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What impact has the coronavirus outbreak had on your sales? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Initially, it was impacting us more in places like China and global travel retail, and since our businesses weren&apos;t very large in China, it didn&apos;t have such an impact. In a lot of airports, essentially the stores were closed. People were traveling but they weren&apos;t visiting stores to buy goods, and we could see that in January and February. </p>
<p>
     In March, we&apos;ve seen a larger hit in Western Europe. In the U.S., you&apos;re seeing a huge spike in the sales in the liquor stores, the grocery stores, Kroger, Costco, those kinds of outlets. People were stocking up in anticipation of the long term. You&apos;re seeing similar trends around the globe. While restaurants have closed down, the grocers, the liquor stores are seeing huge spikes in sales. </p>
<p>
     The global percentage of our sales coming from liquor stores, grocers, large formatted stores is in the region of 75%. Then the balance comes from restaurants, bars, pubs, etc. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Do you think it will balance out, or will you see a net drop? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: I think we will see a slight drop. The unknown is, how long is this going to continue? If it is three months, we are prepared for it. If it goes six months to a year, we&apos;ll have to re-evaluate our strategies. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Many other spirits have premiumization, with consumers willing to spend more for higher-quality spirits. Rum is late to that party. Why? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: When you look at categories like scotch, they had to come from Scotland, tequila had to come from Mexico. </p>
<p>
     When you look at rum, you had rum in the Philippines, in India, in the Caribbean. Nobody defined what rum should be. Therefore, you had rum being produced as a cheap spirit, catering to the masses. Now people are putting a lot more emphasis on the source. </p>
<p>
     You are seeing consumers saying, &quot;I like my rum coming from the Caribbean.&quot; Therefore, you are seeing a shift toward people willing to pay more money at the premium end. </p>
<p>
     About two years back, we launched our dark rums -- Bacardi 4, Bacardi 8, Bacardi 10 -- and we just launched Bacardi 16. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Since the coronavirus outbreak, is the premiumization trend continuing? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Absolutely. In the U.S., people are moving to very cheap products or to very expensive products. The midprice products are getting a beating. People who are wanting to save for a rainy day are saying, &quot;I will downgrade,&quot; but a lot of people sitting at home are saying, &quot;Let me treat myself to the best cocktail, or a nice bottle of wine and enjoy that with the family.&quot; </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Younger people drink less than their parents and grandparents. What does that mean for Bacardi and for the spirits industry? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Ten years, 20 years back, when you looked at the spirits industry, you had the youth drinking to get drunk. We don&apos;t see that anymore. You are seeing people being in control. They want to have drinks that provide them with the taste, but they&apos;re very conscious about the calories. Therefore, you&apos;re seeing the rise of things like vermouth, like spritz. </p>
<p>
     We&apos;ve just launched a brand called Martini 0.0, and it&apos;s a sparkling wine. It&apos;s exactly the same-tasting product, but it has zero alcohol, and we&apos;re having that tested out in places like Saudi Arabia and South Africa and the Philippines, to learn more from consumers before we take it globally. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: So, the spirits industry in the future, is it making a whole bunch of nonalcoholic beverages? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: You&apos;re going to see a certain portion of spirits going into low or no alcohol. We&apos;re also seeing a trend of consumers wanting to drink better and drink more premium. They&apos;re saying, &quot;I&apos;m conscious about what I put in my body, I&apos;m very conscious about the calories, and therefore, when I drink, I want to make sure I really drink the best.&quot; It augurs very well for Bacardi, because we have a premium and a superpremium portfolio. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Beer companies now are diversifying. Anheuser-Busch is selling canned cocktails, canned wine, ice tea and bottled water. Molson Coors wants to sell coffee and tea and kombucha. Are spirits companies going to have to diversify in a similar way? Are you going to have to start selling hard seltzer, which is essentially a beer product? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: You had spirit companies doing this long before the beer guys caught up with it, and I certainly see the spirit companies coming back with products and drinks that are in the same area of basically being healthy, being flavorful, using natural ingredients, being low in alcohol, being tasty and flavorful, and it can be done with a spirit product, too. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What&apos;s your take on at-home cocktail machines? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: It&apos;s an idea we worked on in 2010, and then we shelved it. We felt it was cumbersome for a consumer to buy another machine. It takes a lot of money in terms of investment, and you are then limited to that choice of what that machine can do. </p>
<p>
     Having said that, we are very excited about something we have in our pipeline. It&apos;s about making a cocktail at home in an accessible way, where you don&apos;t need a machine, but at the same time, you have the ability to deliver a consistent, great-tasting cocktail to drink with your family and your friends at home. Unfortunately, we are not ready with it. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Have you seen similar trends in markets overseas that you see in the U.S., in terms of younger people drinking less and more thoughtfully? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Thirteen years back, if you went across the world, you would see a lot of our spirit brands being consumed in nightclubs, high energy, high music. That is on the decrease. What we have seen more is restaurants, bars that provide an all-around experience. So, having a Michelin Star chef, getting great cocktails with the food, and engaging consumers and telling them about the process of the cooking or the art of making cocktails -- consumers are willing to pay for that. </p>
<p>
     Cautious times </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Is behavior going to change in the long run? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Having seen SARS and several other similar issues in Asia, I certainly believe that in the short run, people will be wary and not go out. But in the long run, the human being is great at forgetting the past. It&apos;s a part of healing. I have no doubt you will see music festivals come back. You will see people going back to restaurants and dining. You&apos;ll see people going back to bars. In fact, we believe that when things open up, people are going to party so hard like we&apos;ve never seen before. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: In the meantime, though, as people are cloistered, has your messaging shifted toward making cocktails at home? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: In Southeast Asia, we have started to repurpose our advocacy staff, professional mixologists who go out to train bartenders. We are using that to train bartenders online. We are also starting to have sessions where we can train consumers [online] in terms of how to build a cocktail. </p>

What the Coronavirus Means for Bacardi&apos;s -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     We are also giving a few bartenders around the world a thousand dollars to make a short video helping consumers understand how to make a simple cocktail by using some of the ingredients at home. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What do you make of the coronavirus-era trend of virtual happy hours? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Typically, on Friday evening in Bermuda, we open the bar at about 4:30 for all employees. They&apos;re allowed to bring in one or two of their friends or family. We didn&apos;t want to break that. We said, &quot;Guess what, at 4:30 we will have a virtual happy hour with employees.&quot; For the first one, I think we had about 25 people signing in through Microsoft Teams, talking about their experience that week. It was a fun get-together virtually, where people had the ability to express what they were feeling. </p>
<p>
     I think that&apos;s really important at this time when people are quarantining themselves, just having that ability to see somebody on that screen that you can connect with. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Will the rise in e-commerce last beyond the current crisis? Will people get used to the convenience of having liquor or cocktail ingredients delivered to their homes? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: I think it is definitely going to be a habit that will stay, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to completely replace the fact that people like to walk around the store, touch and feel different products, read the back labels and ingredients of different products. That will always happen. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: You practice mindful drinking. What does that mean to you, and how do you do it? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Nowadays what I do is I just reverse some of the proportions of the drinks. So, if I would have a martini, I would make sure that I have more of the vermouth and less of the Bombay, or less of the gin. For me, it&apos;s all about being watchful of what you take in. You just want to make sure that you enjoy the evening and you&apos;re in control. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: If you didn&apos;t work in the spirits business, would you be happy not drinking alcohol at all? </p>
<p>
     MR. MADHAVAN: Even before I joined the spirits business, I&apos;ve always enjoyed a cocktail. I can see myself, even when I&apos;m 80, enjoying a drink every day. You need to make sure you have that balance in life, and it&apos;s about savoring the drink. It&apos;s enjoying that moment and celebrating that moment of life, with the loved ones that you have next to you. I always say, life is about enjoying moments that matter, and when you bring family or friends together, if you have a cocktail which allows you to have those engaging conversations, why not? </p>

How the Navy Revamped Boot Camp -- Journal Report</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Lauren Weber </pre>
<p>
     Great Lakes, Ill. -- Four nights a week, young people arrive by the busload at the Navy&apos;s Recruit Training Command in this town north of Chicago. As they file off the bus at dusk, they are greeted by shouted commands: &quot;Run, female! Run, male! Move your ass! You will not move this slow again for the next eight weeks!&quot; </p>
<p>
     They&apos;ll stay awake for 24 hours, being outfitted with uniforms and sized for shoes, taking urine tests and receiving vaccinations. Men&apos;s heads will be shaved. They&apos;ll all learn how to respond to orders, address superiors and carry themselves like sailors. </p>
<p>
     These eight weeks look dramatically different today than they did three years ago. </p>
<p>
     Discussions about reforming boot camp began in 2016, but they picked up urgency following a pair of deadly collisions at sea in 2017. The Navy has since overhauled the training that transforms civilians into sailors. The accidents revealed a military culture that had lapsed into complacency and normalized reckless levels of risk, according to Navy investigators -- so the service has gone back to basics, cutting down on classroom learning while beefing up hands-on training in seamanship and responding to emergencies. </p>
<p>
     The service is also scrapping some old ideas about the Navy&apos;s culture. Among other things, it is moving past a &quot;tough it out&quot; mentality -- which may have led to excessive risk-taking -- to a system based on helping trainees focus and stay resilient in the face of challenges and crises. It is also raising the bar for recruits to pass, leading to higher attrition but better-prepared sailors. And it is aiming to deliver continuous training to personnel over the course of their careers to keep their skills sharp. </p>
<p>
     The deep end </p>
<p>
     The Navy&apos;s efforts may not look like typical corporate training -- especially at the massive boot camp, where more than 40,000 recruits arrive annually in waves of up to 900 a week. Few corporations keep new employees awake for 24 hours after they show up, or yell at them the moment they arrive or shave their heads. </p>
<p>
     Still, the military has long been a source of inspiration and fascination for business leaders, and at its best the service manifests qualities executives try to foster in their organizations: dedication to a mission and rigorous discipline. What&apos;s more, the armed forces -- with more than 1.3 million active-duty service members and hundreds of thousands of reservists and civilian employees -- struggle with many of the same challenges private-sector employers face, including overbearing bureaucracy, resistance to change, cultural drift and leadership upheaval. Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, for instance, was fired last year during a conflict with the White House over the disciplining of a Navy SEAL. </p>
<p>
     In this case, the Navy&apos;s boot-camp initiative offers lessons for companies in how to put their practices under a microscope, recognize when big changes are needed, and then make the often difficult adjustments. There are few companies that wouldn&apos;t benefit, for instance, from making their training both more relevant and effective. For the Navy, as for many employers, the motivation to act only gathered urgency in the face of catastrophe. </p>
<p>
     At the Department of Defense, the largest employer in the U.S., training its workforce and maintaining its culture is a matter of life and death. In 2017, 17 sailors died in collisions involving the U.S.S. Fitzgerald and, two months later, the U.S.S. John S. McCain. The incidents left the service and its sailors reeling, unable to avoid the conclusion that something had gone terribly wrong in the Navy&apos;s operations. </p>
<p>
     In the case of the Navy, congressional investigators and military officers had warned repeatedly of overworked sailors, inadequate training and budget cuts in the years leading up to the two collisions, due largely to an overcommitment of Navy ships to overseas missions. </p>
<p>
     Those warnings were mostly ignored by Navy leaders. In September 2017, the Government Accountability Office noted that it had made 11 recommendations in prior years related to the Navy&apos;s readiness, and only one had been implemented. </p>
<p>
     In its favor, the military has a tradition of evaluation and self-correction, says Mr. Collins. &quot;They&apos;re very open about learning from things,&quot; he says. &quot;It goes back to the gravity of the mission and the fact of what&apos;s at stake.&quot; After missions, battles and significant incidents, officers debrief participants and analyze events closely. </p>
<p>
     In this case, it took 17 casualties to force a grim reckoning. </p>
<p>
     A report written by Navy officials soon after the 2017 collisions offered an unstinting appraisal of what had gone wrong. The 33-member review team determined that the incidents were preventable and faulted, among other things, failures in training sailors in the fundamental skills of seamanship. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re not even training them to be sailors&quot; was a refrain that U.S.-based officers were hearing from counterparts commanding ships in the fleet, according to several officers and senior enlistees. </p>
<p>
     Reps and sets </p>
<p>
     The Navy is now focusing hard on basics. Officers and administrators have rewritten 60% of boot camp&apos;s two-month curriculum, tightening standards and emphasizing fundamentals like firefighting, damage control such as plugging leaks and day-to-day equipment repairs, and standing watch. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you can&apos;t fight a fire, you&apos;re not going to be a sailor,&quot; says Rear Adm. Jamie Sands, the Navy SEAL who was tapped in spring 2019 to command several training programs, including boot camp. &quot;We&apos;ll remediate you, we&apos;ll try to get you there, but if you can&apos;t get there, you can&apos;t be a sailor.&quot; Adm. Sands keeps a copy of the Navy&apos;s report on his desk at all times to remind him that when the service sends poorly trained sailors out to sea, lives are lost. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This isn&apos;t summer camp,&quot; says Tanya Mojica, a boatswain&apos;s mate, a few days after graduating from boot camp in August. &quot;This is your life.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The single biggest change the Navy has made to boot camp is immersing recruits in experiential learning to simulate, as closely as possible, conditions aboard a ship in times of peace or war. Recruits now receive 177 hours of hands-on learning during their eight weeks, up from 160 hours in 2017. Classroom instruction fell, as elements were removed, condensed or pushed to subsequent training periods. </p>
<p>
     In each of the 13 barracks that house recruits at Great Lakes, &quot;we literally tore out computer labs, removed all the desks and turned them into ship decks to practice basic war-fighting competencies,&quot; says Adm. Sands. </p>
<p>
     Commanders, who lead boot-camp divisions of around 88 recruits and are responsible for their performance, now assess their divisions&apos; weaknesses and use blocks of time once devoted to online learning to have their recruits drill skills like patching pipes or tying knots to anchor and moor a ship. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Think of a pitcher who throws thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of pitches, so he knows the precise feel, the precise hand movements of a good pitch. That&apos;s what we&apos;re trying to do now,&quot; says Rear Adm. Kyle Cozad, who oversees all education and training for the Navy. &quot;We&apos;re doing reps and sets to develop muscle memory.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;The assumption is that there&apos;s complexity to these tasks, so you will probably have multiple cycles of failure on your way to success,&quot; says Elliott Masie, a training-and-development expert who has visited boot camp at Great Lakes and once brought a delegation of leaders from firms like Accenture, Walmart and McDonald&apos;s to observe the Navy&apos;s training methods. &quot;They don&apos;t just tolerate it; they structure in failure.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Recruits spend two days inside the U.S.S. Marlinspike, a facility at Great Lakes containing a life-size replica of the deck of a surface ship and a classroom outfitted with ropes and bollards, the posts to which ships are tied. There, recruits practice tying lines, relaying orders, getting a ship under way and bringing it back to port. The only thing missing is water. </p>
<p>
     During practice on the replica, instructors ring a bell every time recruits make a mistake. Each bell signals an error that could result in a sailor tumbling overboard in a real-life situation, says William Haines, a gunner&apos;s mate who attended boot camp last summer. </p>
<p>
     When his division first attempted the exercise of bringing a ship to port, the bell rang 27 times, he says, and the division blew its allotted 25-minute deadline. After that, &quot;we promised our instructor we would do it in under 20 minutes, with no safety strikes. And we did,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>
     To graduate, recruits must pass an all-night test called &quot;battle stations,&quot; proving their skills in an environment designed to look and feel like the deck and hull of a warship. As water floods through a burst pipe, they must identify and repair the leak and move boxes of ammunition to dry storage. In another area, an explosion is followed by smoke and alarms; dummies stand in for sailors with injuries, some fatal. The recruits put out fires and extract the wounded. </p>
<p>
     Battle stations used to be more of an exercise with coaching from instructors; it is now an evaluation of skills, and failure just before the finish line isn&apos;t uncommon, officers say. On rare occasions, commanders fail entire divisions if recruits don&apos;t display teamwork. Some who fail get one chance to retake the test with another division; others are discharged. </p>
<p>
     Pause and refocus </p>
<p>
     The Navy has also begun to see the limits of its longtime &quot;tough it out&quot; approach. Boot camp is still a crucible, and it is designed accordingly. Recruits are yelled at, insulted, broken down. Between 10% and 12% drop out before graduation; the attrition rate has increased 3 percentage points since the boot-camp changes were implemented. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We shock them into the military lifestyle,&quot; says Chief Petty Officer Daniel Rainmaker, who was formerly part of the team that initiates new recruits on their first night. &quot;Many of them have never been yelled at in their lives.&quot; </p>

How the Navy Revamped Boot Camp -- Journal Report -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     But the Navy is redefining toughness in the wake of the deadly accidents. One explanation for the incidents was that officers pushed to follow orders, and didn&apos;t question bad decisions, even though they didn&apos;t have enough resources to do what they were told. </p>
<p>
     So, the Navy is absorbing research about resilience and mindfulness and folding that into a program called Warrior Toughness, which was implemented in the summer of 2018 and is now integrated into nearly every aspect of boot camp. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve all been told in the past to suck it up and push through,&quot; says Senior Chief Petty Officer Warren Caverly, who previously ran the gym where recruits do daily fitness drills and tests. Recruits are taught to mentally and physically recalibrate -- pause and refocus -- if they are struggling, and encouraged to talk about problems they are having. </p>
<p>
     All boot camp officers, instructors and recruit division commanders -- the chiefs who oversee recruits as they make their way through boot camp -- attend five 90-minute classes taught by psychologists, chaplains and service members who work in high-pressure environments, such as technicians who dispose of sea mines, torpedoes and other explosives. </p>
<p>
     Warrior toughness &quot;is like hitting control-alt-delete on a computer,&quot; Mr. Caverly says. </p>
<p>
     The Navy is trying to fine-tune the program&apos;s balance of stress and support. Boot camp &quot;is a combination of a supportive environment, a challenging environment and a tough-love environment,&quot; says Mr. Masie. &quot;There are very few corporations that do that as holistically as they do.&quot; </p>
<p>
     At the Olympic-size swimming pool at Great Lakes, all recruits must pass a test showing they can jump off a 10-foot-high platform, swim a full length of the pool, float on their stomachs for five minutes, and turn their uniforms into flotation devices. Some of them cannot swim and have never been in a pool. </p>
<p>
     It is a test recruits have done for some time. Now, though, before the test, an instructor reads a Warrior Toughness briefing that involves visualizing the exercise and doing deep breathing. &quot;Feel the ground beneath your feet. You climb the ladder confidently and deliberately.... When you get to the top, you smell the chlorine. You see yourself stepping willingly over the platform.... Feel the sensation of your body rising to the surface with ease.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Does it work? As in the past, some recruits panic when they hit the water, come up gasping for air and are pulled to the side by instructors wielding long poles. Many can&apos;t complete the full length and are sent to a smaller pool for remedial classes -- and, as before, they are allowed to take the test multiple times. </p>
<p>
     In previous years, says Capt. Erik Thors, who oversees boot camp, 1.6% of recruits were &quot;swim failures.&quot; That number has dropped to 0.4%. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Statistically, we see better physical-fitness scores, more push-ups, faster run scores,&quot; he says. &quot;Warrior Toughness taps into the mental block and helps people realize they can do a heck of a lot more than they thought.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For now, Warrior Toughness is confined to boot camp, but the Navy plans to introduce it to the fleet. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We want to affect the dynamic of the Navy from the bottom up,&quot; Capt. Thors says. &quot;With 40,000 sailors leaving here every year, we&apos;ll change the fabric of one-third of the Navy within three years.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Still, it is unclear what impact Warrior Toughness and the refocus on hands-on learning are having so far. Adm. Sands and others at Great Lakes say they are hearing anecdotally from officers in the fleet that sailors are arriving on ships with a stronger set of skills. But it may take years to develop a more comprehensive view on the changes&apos; impact. </p>
<p>
     The Government Accountability Office recently reviewed changes made to the Navy&apos;s training for surface warfare officers, high-ranking sailors who drive ships, lead crews and are responsible for ship safety and operations, in the wake of the 2017 crashes. According to the GAO&apos;s November 2019 report, senior Navy officials estimated it would take 16 years to determine whether those changes had been effective. The agency also said the service had not put in place effective methods for evaluating the impact of those adjustments, suggesting the Navy still needs to figure out how to track its progress.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ready, Relevant Learning </p>
<p>
     The Navy isn&apos;t just thinking about training at boot camp. Its officers, like many company managers, are talking about lifelong learning -- a contrast to the service&apos;s longtime &quot;one and done&quot; attitude toward training. Sailors received follow-up training as they progressed through their trades, but the Navy got complacent about assessing proficiency and refreshing people&apos;s skills as equipment was modernized or missions changed, Adm. Cozad says. For example, congressional investigators found that, as of June 2017, 37% of skill certifications for some crews based in Japan had expired, a fivefold increase from two years earlier. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We used to take a sailor from boot camp, and plug them into a training system focused on everything they would need in a 10- to 20-year career, &quot; he says. &quot;But not every sailor will stay in for 20 years, so some training was never realized. We also zeroed in on the fact that training has a shelf life.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;The speed of mission change is faster than ever,&quot; says Mr. Masie. The military is &quot;needing to now train in a way that they can get pretty radically and quickly uptrained, retrained and augmented as things change.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Navy is slowly integrating an approach called Ready, Relevant Learning, designed as a &quot;continuum that allows us to target the right skills at the right time and the right place,&quot; says Adm. Cozad. Most sailors get specialized training right after boot camp, and depending on one&apos;s rating, or occupation, there is usually follow-up training in the setting that makes the most sense, such as on board ships or at a base. </p>
<p>
     The Navy is revising its training methods for more than 75% of its approximately 80 occupations, beginning with operations specialist -- which Naval investigators called out for training deficiencies that contributed to the 2017 collisions. </p>
<p>
     Operations specialists operate radar, navigation and communication equipment on ships, detecting and tracking nearby ships, aircraft and other objects. </p>
<p>
     The Navy&apos;s review team found that operations specialists were unprepared to manage ships&apos; navigation systems and operate surface radars to monitor what was happening in the waters around ships. Their training also hadn&apos;t been updated regularly to include information about new consoles and technology used to steer. </p>
<p>
     The material and the delivery methods at post-boot camp training for operations specialists have been modernized away from rote memorization to practical application, says Lt. J. Ray Norris, who runs the school at Great Lakes where new graduates get their first specialized training for the rating, known as the &quot;A,&quot; or Accession, school. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It would be like, &apos;Look at this, hold it in your memory until we test you on it on Friday.&apos; They data dumped as soon as they left here,&quot; he says. Now, 80% of the curriculum is hands-on work with simulations and interactive courseware and 20% is lectures, with more engaging lessons built around scenarios experienced in the fleet. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We all hear, this generation really loves computers,&quot; says Capt. David Dwyer, who oversees the post-boot camp training at Great Lakes. &quot;Well, they like to play games. They still don&apos;t like computer-based training.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Post-boot camp training now is more self-paced and interactive. &quot;We went from 1970s-style teaching to 2019,&quot; says Lt. Norris. The program was piloted in April, and the first class that used it graduated in May. Full implementation took place in September. Now, the goal is, sailors won&apos;t need to relearn the basics when they arrive on their ships. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re taking 18-year-olds that don&apos;t know anything about being an operations specialist, the most vital job on the ship, and in 34 days we&apos;re sending them to a destroyer,&quot; says Lt. Norris. &quot;And probably within a month of getting there, they&apos;re qualified, proficient, making recommendations to a captain during a mission.&quot; </p>
<p>
     That is no small thing. A number of reports even before the 2017 collisions had faulted the Navy for understaffing ships and overworking sailors, leading to fatigue and burnout. The understaffing stems from earlier decisions, debated fiercely inside the service, to prioritize building new ships and maintaining a heavy load of missions despite cuts to the workforce. The Navy is rethinking that approach, but major changes haven&apos;t happened. </p>
<p>
     On the ships, sailors can only take a full load of responsibilities once they are qualified, a process that can involve oral and written tests, as well as senior sailors signing off on a list of competencies. The Navy hopes its improved training will speed up that process. </p>
<p>
     It also hopes that the tighter focus on standards, resilience and fundamentals will help the service avoid collisions like those back in 2017. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We had a little cultural drift of &apos;that can never happen to me. Maybe I won&apos;t have to fight a fire on a ship,&apos; &quot; says Adm. Sands. That attitude led to complacency, he says. &quot;When you take ownership of the problem, you can start to address it,&quot; he adds. </p>

Press Release: Edwards SAPIEN 3 Valve Shows Excellent Results At 2 Years</headline>

<p>
  Edwards SAPIEN 3 Valve Shows Excellent Results At 2 Years </p>
<p>
  PR Newswire </p>
<p>
  IRVINE, Calif., March 29, 2020 </p>
<p>
  IRVINE, Calif., March 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), the global leader in patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, today announced 2-year results of the randomized PARTNER 3 trial comparing treatment with the SAPIEN 3 valve to surgery in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) at low risk of death from surgery. </p>
<p>
  Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the SAPIEN 3 valve continued to demonstrate favorable results for low-risk patients over surgery. TAVR resulted in a 37 percent reduction in the event rate for the primary endpoint of the trial, which was a composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke and rehospitalization at two years. Death and stroke rates were both low between TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) at two years, and TAVR patients experienced a significantly lower rate of rehospitalization. The results of the trial were presented online today as part of the late-breaking clinical trials by the American College of Cardiology&apos;s Annual Scientific Session Together with World Congress of Cardiology (ACC.20/WCC). </p>
<p>
  &quot;We are encouraged by the results of the PARTNER 3 study, including the similarly low rates of death and stroke for both TAVR and SAVR, which continue to build on a robust body of evidence,&quot; said Michael J. Mack, M.D., chairman of the cardiovascular service line at Baylor Scott &amp; White Health and chairman of the board for the Baylor Scott &amp; White Research Institute. &quot;We are committed to 10-year clinical and echocardiographic follow-up of patients in this trial, which may help inform the medical community going forward.&quot; </p>
<p>
  The PARTNER 3 trial randomized 1,000 patients at 71 centers between March 2016 and October 2017. Low-risk patients were assigned to undergo either TAVR with the SAPIEN 3 valve or surgery with any commercially available surgical valve. </p>
<p>
  &quot;These data demonstrate that TAVR with the SAPIEN 3 valve continues to perform well at two years, which gives low surgical risk patients with severe AS the ability to choose a treatment that factors in their individual priorities in consultation with their physician,&quot; said Larry Wood, Edwards&apos; corporate vice president, transcatheter aortic valve replacement. </p>
<p>
  The SAPIEN 3 valve was approved in August 2019 in the United States for the treatment of low risk patients with severe, symptomatic AS. To date, more than 650,000 patients around the world have benefitted from TAVR. </p>

Press Release: Medtronic Evolut TAVR System Demonstrates Excellent Outcomes in Study of Low-Risk Patients with Bicuspid Aortic Stenosis</headline>
<text>
<pre>
 
   ACC.20/WCC: Low Rates of Paravalvular Leak and High Survival Observed in 
Late-breaking Clinical Trial of Low-Risk Bicuspid Aortic Stenosis 
Patients 
 
   DUBLIN, March 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), 
the global leader in medical technology, today announced late-breaking 
clinical data from the Low Risk Bicuspid Study assessing the use of the 
Evolut(TM) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) system in 
patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis at low surgical risk. The 
study showed low rates of all-cause mortality or stroke at 30 days 
(1.3%) with a low rate of serious procedural complications, and no 
annular rupture or aortic dissection. The study was presented as part of 
the American College of Cardiology together with World Congress of 
Cardiology Scientific Sessions (ACC.20/WCC) meeting. 
 
   Results from the 150-patient, single-arm study showed excellent outcomes 
at 30 days, with a 95.3% device success rate and a low rate of serious 
procedural complications including no annular ruptures or aortic 
dissection. In addition, results from the study showed: 
 
 
   --  Low rate of all-cause mortality (0.7%) 
 
   --  Low rate of disabling stroke (0.7%) 
 
   --  Exceptional hemodynamics with low mean AV gradients (7.6 +/- 3.7 mm Hg), 
      and large effective orifice area (2.3 +/- 0.7 cm2) 
 
   --  No incidence of moderate or severe paravalvular leak (PVL) 
 
   --  Low rate of major vascular complications (1.3%) 
 
   --  High utilization of the Evolut 34 mm (41.6% of patients in the study 
      were implanted with this larger valve size) 
 
   --  New pacemaker rate (15.1%) was lower than in the Evolut Low Risk Trial 
 
 
   &quot;These findings point to a potentially less invasive treatment for 
patients who otherwise would undergo open heart surgery due to their 
anatomical valve structure,&quot; said Basel Ramlawi, M.D., chair of The 
Heart &amp; Vascular Center at FACC Valley Health System in Winchester, Va., 
and co-primary investigator of the study who presented the data at the 
meeting. &quot;We feel confident that these primary early outcomes provide 
additional evidence that the Evolut TAVR platform is a suitable 
treatment option for patients with bicuspid valves who have previously 
been left out of TAVR trials.&quot; 
 
   Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases 
in the world(1) , affecting 1.5 million individuals(2) . Bicuspid aortic 
valve disease (BAVD) is a congenital heart defect affecting 
approximately two percent of the general population and is an 
abnormality of the aortic valve resulting in the patient having two 
functional valve leaflets instead of the more common three leaflets 
(tricuspid). Often younger than tricuspid AS patients (median age of 70 
in the study), patients with BAVD were generally excluded from prior 
TAVR trials due to concerns of asymmetric calcification, elliptical 
shape, potential incomplete valve expansion, procedural technical 
concerns and other risk factors. In 2018, Medtronic received U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for revised commercial labeling 
for the Evolut TAVR system that removed a precaution for the treatment 
of bicuspid severe AS patients deemed at intermediate or greater risk 
for surgical aortic valve replacement. It is estimated that 
approximately 60% of the low risk TAVR patient population have BAVD. The 
Evolut TAVR system is not currently approved in any geography for use in 
patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis at low surgical risk. 
 
   &quot;Evidence continues to support the use of TAVR with the Evolut platform 
in groups of patients previously thought to be more challenging, or 
non-candidates for the procedures. In addition to reaffirming the Evolut 
valve&apos;s exceptionally strong hemodynamic, today&apos;s data indicate that 
low-risk bicuspid aortic stenosis patients implanted with TAVR do very 
well,&quot; said Pieter Kappetein, M.D., vice president, medical affairs for 
the Structural Heart business, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular 
Group at Medtronic. &quot;We&apos;ve observed the Evolut TAVR valve to be a 
suitable treatment option for many patients with bicuspid aortic valve 
disease at intermediate risk or higher, and these data are encouraging 
that we may see a similar outcome in low-risk patients.&quot; 
 
   Medtronic is a leading innovator of heart valve therapies, including the 
first transcatheter pulmonic valve, the first self-expanding and 
recapturable transcatheter aortic valve, and the first transcatheter 
mitral valve replacement technology to be studied in a global pivotal 
trial. The Evolut TAVR platform -- including the Evolut(TM) R, 
Evolut(TM) PRO and Evolut PRO+ TAVR Systems -- is indicated for 
symptomatic severe AS patients across all risk categories (extreme, high, 
intermediate and low) in the U.S. Bicuspid valve patients at 
intermediate risk or higher may be candidates for TAVR in the U.S.

How the Navy Revamped Boot Camp -- Journal Report</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Lauren Weber </pre>
<p>
     Great Lakes, Ill. -- Four nights a week, young people arrive by the busload at the Navy&apos;s Recruit Training Command in this town north of Chicago. As they file off the bus at dusk, they are greeted by shouted commands: &quot;Run, female! Run, male! Move your ass! You will not move this slow again for the next eight weeks!&quot; </p>
<p>
     They&apos;ll stay awake for 24 hours, being outfitted with uniforms and sized for shoes, taking urine tests and receiving vaccinations. Men&apos;s heads will be shaved. They&apos;ll all learn how to respond to orders, address superiors and carry themselves like sailors. </p>
<p>
     These eight weeks look dramatically different today than they did three years ago. </p>
<p>
     Discussions about reforming boot camp began in 2016, but they picked up urgency following a pair of deadly collisions at sea in 2017. The Navy has since overhauled the training that transforms civilians into sailors. The accidents revealed a military culture that had lapsed into complacency and normalized reckless levels of risk, according to Navy investigators -- so the service has gone back to basics, cutting down on classroom learning while beefing up hands-on training in seamanship and responding to emergencies. </p>
<p>
     The service is also scrapping some old ideas about the Navy&apos;s culture. Among other things, it is moving past a &quot;tough it out&quot; mentality -- which may have led to excessive risk-taking -- to a system based on helping trainees focus and stay resilient in the face of challenges and crises. It is also raising the bar for recruits to pass, leading to higher attrition but better-prepared sailors. And it is aiming to deliver continuous training to personnel over the course of their careers to keep their skills sharp. </p>
<p>
     The deep end </p>
<p>
     The Navy&apos;s efforts may not look like typical corporate training -- especially at the massive boot camp, where more than 40,000 recruits arrive annually in waves of up to 900 a week. Few corporations keep new employees awake for 24 hours after they show up, or yell at them the moment they arrive or shave their heads. </p>
<p>
     Still, the military has long been a source of inspiration and fascination for business leaders, and at its best the service manifests qualities executives try to foster in their organizations: dedication to a mission and rigorous discipline. What&apos;s more, the armed forces -- with more than 1.3 million active-duty service members and hundreds of thousands of reservists and civilian employees -- struggle with many of the same challenges private-sector employers face, including overbearing bureaucracy, resistance to change, cultural drift and leadership upheaval. Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, for instance, was fired last year during a conflict with the White House over the disciplining of a Navy SEAL. </p>
<p>
     In this case, the Navy&apos;s boot-camp initiative offers lessons for companies in how to put their practices under a microscope, recognize when big changes are needed, and then make the often difficult adjustments. There are few companies that wouldn&apos;t benefit, for instance, from making their training both more relevant and effective. For the Navy, as for many employers, the motivation to act only gathered urgency in the face of catastrophe. </p>
<p>
     At the Department of Defense, the largest employer in the U.S., training its workforce and maintaining its culture is a matter of life and death. In 2017, 17 sailors died in collisions involving the U.S.S. Fitzgerald and, two months later, the U.S.S. John S. McCain. The incidents left the service and its sailors reeling, unable to avoid the conclusion that something had gone terribly wrong in the Navy&apos;s operations. </p>
<p>
     In the case of the Navy, congressional investigators and military officers had warned repeatedly of overworked sailors, inadequate training and budget cuts in the years leading up to the two collisions, due largely to an overcommitment of Navy ships to overseas missions. </p>
<p>
     Those warnings were mostly ignored by Navy leaders. In September 2017, the Government Accountability Office noted that it had made 11 recommendations in prior years related to the Navy&apos;s readiness, and only one had been implemented. </p>
<p>
     In its favor, the military has a tradition of evaluation and self-correction, says Mr. Collins. &quot;They&apos;re very open about learning from things,&quot; he says. &quot;It goes back to the gravity of the mission and the fact of what&apos;s at stake.&quot; After missions, battles and significant incidents, officers debrief participants and analyze events closely. </p>
<p>
     In this case, it took 17 casualties to force a grim reckoning. </p>
<p>
     A report written by Navy officials soon after the 2017 collisions offered an unstinting appraisal of what had gone wrong. The 33-member review team determined that the incidents were preventable and faulted, among other things, failures in training sailors in the fundamental skills of seamanship. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re not even training them to be sailors&quot; was a refrain that U.S.-based officers were hearing from counterparts commanding ships in the fleet, according to several officers and senior enlistees. </p>
<p>
     Reps and sets </p>
<p>
     The Navy is now focusing hard on basics. Officers and administrators have rewritten 60% of boot camp&apos;s two-month curriculum, tightening standards and emphasizing fundamentals like firefighting, damage control such as plugging leaks and day-to-day equipment repairs, and standing watch. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you can&apos;t fight a fire, you&apos;re not going to be a sailor,&quot; says Rear Adm. Jamie Sands, the Navy SEAL who was tapped in spring 2019 to command several training programs, including boot camp. &quot;We&apos;ll remediate you, we&apos;ll try to get you there, but if you can&apos;t get there, you can&apos;t be a sailor.&quot; Adm. Sands keeps a copy of the Navy&apos;s report on his desk at all times to remind him that when the service sends poorly trained sailors out to sea, lives are lost. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This isn&apos;t summer camp,&quot; says Tanya Mojica, a boatswain&apos;s mate, a few days after graduating from boot camp in August. &quot;This is your life.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The single biggest change the Navy has made to boot camp is immersing recruits in experiential learning to simulate, as closely as possible, conditions aboard a ship in times of peace or war. Recruits now receive 177 hours of hands-on learning during their eight weeks, up from 160 hours in 2017. Classroom instruction fell, as elements were removed, condensed or pushed to subsequent training periods. </p>
<p>
     In each of the 13 barracks that house recruits at Great Lakes, &quot;we literally tore out computer labs, removed all the desks and turned them into ship decks to practice basic war-fighting competencies,&quot; says Adm. Sands. </p>
<p>
     Commanders, who lead boot-camp divisions of around 88 recruits and are responsible for their performance, now assess their divisions&apos; weaknesses and use blocks of time once devoted to online learning to have their recruits drill skills like patching pipes or tying knots to anchor and moor a ship. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Think of a pitcher who throws thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of pitches, so he knows the precise feel, the precise hand movements of a good pitch. That&apos;s what we&apos;re trying to do now,&quot; says Rear Adm. Kyle Cozad, who oversees all education and training for the Navy. &quot;We&apos;re doing reps and sets to develop muscle memory.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;The assumption is that there&apos;s complexity to these tasks, so you will probably have multiple cycles of failure on your way to success,&quot; says Elliott Masie, a training-and-development expert who has visited boot camp at Great Lakes and once brought a delegation of leaders from firms like Accenture, Walmart and McDonald&apos;s to observe the Navy&apos;s training methods. &quot;They don&apos;t just tolerate it; they structure in failure.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Recruits spend two days inside the U.S.S. Marlinspike, a facility at Great Lakes containing a life-size replica of the deck of a surface ship and a classroom outfitted with ropes and bollards, the posts to which ships are tied. There, recruits practice tying lines, relaying orders, getting a ship under way and bringing it back to port. The only thing missing is water. </p>
<p>
     During practice on the replica, instructors ring a bell every time recruits make a mistake. Each bell signals an error that could result in a sailor tumbling overboard in a real-life situation, says William Haines, a gunner&apos;s mate who attended boot camp last summer. </p>
<p>
     When his division first attempted the exercise of bringing a ship to port, the bell rang 27 times, he says, and the division blew its allotted 25-minute deadline. After that, &quot;we promised our instructor we would do it in under 20 minutes, with no safety strikes. And we did,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>
     To graduate, recruits must pass an all-night test called &quot;battle stations,&quot; proving their skills in an environment designed to look and feel like the deck and hull of a warship. As water floods through a burst pipe, they must identify and repair the leak and move boxes of ammunition to dry storage. In another area, an explosion is followed by smoke and alarms; dummies stand in for sailors with injuries, some fatal. The recruits put out fires and extract the wounded. </p>
<p>
     Battle stations used to be more of an exercise with coaching from instructors; it is now an evaluation of skills, and failure just before the finish line isn&apos;t uncommon, officers say. On rare occasions, commanders fail entire divisions if recruits don&apos;t display teamwork. Some who fail get one chance to retake the test with another division; others are discharged. </p>
<p>
     Pause and refocus </p>
<p>
     The Navy has also begun to see the limits of its longtime &quot;tough it out&quot; approach. Boot camp is still a crucible, and it is designed accordingly. Recruits are yelled at, insulted, broken down. Between 10% and 12% drop out before graduation; the attrition rate has increased 3 percentage points since the boot-camp changes were implemented. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We shock them into the military lifestyle,&quot; says Chief Petty Officer Daniel Rainmaker, who was formerly part of the team that initiates new recruits on their first night. &quot;Many of them have never been yelled at in their lives.&quot; </p>

How the Navy Revamped Boot Camp -- Journal Report -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     But the Navy is redefining toughness in the wake of the deadly accidents. One explanation for the incidents was that officers pushed to follow orders, and didn&apos;t question bad decisions, even though they didn&apos;t have enough resources to do what they were told. </p>
<p>
     So, the Navy is absorbing research about resilience and mindfulness and folding that into a program called Warrior Toughness, which was implemented in the summer of 2018 and is now integrated into nearly every aspect of boot camp. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve all been told in the past to suck it up and push through,&quot; says Senior Chief Petty Officer Warren Caverly, who previously ran the gym where recruits do daily fitness drills and tests. Recruits are taught to mentally and physically recalibrate -- pause and refocus -- if they are struggling, and encouraged to talk about problems they are having. </p>
<p>
     All boot camp officers, instructors and recruit division commanders -- the chiefs who oversee recruits as they make their way through boot camp -- attend five 90-minute classes taught by psychologists, chaplains and service members who work in high-pressure environments, such as technicians who dispose of sea mines, torpedoes and other explosives. </p>
<p>
     Warrior toughness &quot;is like hitting control-alt-delete on a computer,&quot; Mr. Caverly says. </p>
<p>
     The Navy is trying to fine-tune the program&apos;s balance of stress and support. Boot camp &quot;is a combination of a supportive environment, a challenging environment and a tough-love environment,&quot; says Mr. Masie. &quot;There are very few corporations that do that as holistically as they do.&quot; </p>
<p>
     At the Olympic-size swimming pool at Great Lakes, all recruits must pass a test showing they can jump off a 10-foot-high platform, swim a full length of the pool, float on their stomachs for five minutes, and turn their uniforms into flotation devices. Some of them cannot swim and have never been in a pool. </p>
<p>
     It is a test recruits have done for some time. Now, though, before the test, an instructor reads a Warrior Toughness briefing that involves visualizing the exercise and doing deep breathing. &quot;Feel the ground beneath your feet. You climb the ladder confidently and deliberately.... When you get to the top, you smell the chlorine. You see yourself stepping willingly over the platform.... Feel the sensation of your body rising to the surface with ease.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Does it work? As in the past, some recruits panic when they hit the water, come up gasping for air and are pulled to the side by instructors wielding long poles. Many can&apos;t complete the full length and are sent to a smaller pool for remedial classes -- and, as before, they are allowed to take the test multiple times. </p>
<p>
     In previous years, says Capt. Erik Thors, who oversees boot camp, 1.6% of recruits were &quot;swim failures.&quot; That number has dropped to 0.4%. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Statistically, we see better physical-fitness scores, more push-ups, faster run scores,&quot; he says. &quot;Warrior Toughness taps into the mental block and helps people realize they can do a heck of a lot more than they thought.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For now, Warrior Toughness is confined to boot camp, but the Navy plans to introduce it to the fleet. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We want to affect the dynamic of the Navy from the bottom up,&quot; Capt. Thors says. &quot;With 40,000 sailors leaving here every year, we&apos;ll change the fabric of one-third of the Navy within three years.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Still, it is unclear what impact Warrior Toughness and the refocus on hands-on learning are having so far. Adm. Sands and others at Great Lakes say they are hearing anecdotally from officers in the fleet that sailors are arriving on ships with a stronger set of skills. But it may take years to develop a more comprehensive view on the changes&apos; impact. </p>
<p>
     The Government Accountability Office recently reviewed changes made to the Navy&apos;s training for surface warfare officers, high-ranking sailors who drive ships, lead crews and are responsible for ship safety and operations, in the wake of the 2017 crashes. According to the GAO&apos;s November 2019 report, senior Navy officials estimated it would take 16 years to determine whether those changes had been effective. The agency also said the service had not put in place effective methods for evaluating the impact of those adjustments, suggesting the Navy still needs to figure out how to track its progress.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ready, Relevant Learning </p>
<p>
     The Navy isn&apos;t just thinking about training at boot camp. Its officers, like many company managers, are talking about lifelong learning -- a contrast to the service&apos;s longtime &quot;one and done&quot; attitude toward training. Sailors received follow-up training as they progressed through their trades, but the Navy got complacent about assessing proficiency and refreshing people&apos;s skills as equipment was modernized or missions changed, Adm. Cozad says. For example, congressional investigators found that, as of June 2017, 37% of skill certifications for some crews based in Japan had expired, a fivefold increase from two years earlier. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We used to take a sailor from boot camp, and plug them into a training system focused on everything they would need in a 10- to 20-year career, &quot; he says. &quot;But not every sailor will stay in for 20 years, so some training was never realized. We also zeroed in on the fact that training has a shelf life.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;The speed of mission change is faster than ever,&quot; says Mr. Masie. The military is &quot;needing to now train in a way that they can get pretty radically and quickly uptrained, retrained and augmented as things change.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Navy is slowly integrating an approach called Ready, Relevant Learning, designed as a &quot;continuum that allows us to target the right skills at the right time and the right place,&quot; says Adm. Cozad. Most sailors get specialized training right after boot camp, and depending on one&apos;s rating, or occupation, there is usually follow-up training in the setting that makes the most sense, such as on board ships or at a base. </p>
<p>
     The Navy is revising its training methods for more than 75% of its approximately 80 occupations, beginning with operations specialist -- which Naval investigators called out for training deficiencies that contributed to the 2017 collisions. </p>
<p>
     Operations specialists operate radar, navigation and communication equipment on ships, detecting and tracking nearby ships, aircraft and other objects. </p>
<p>
     The Navy&apos;s review team found that operations specialists were unprepared to manage ships&apos; navigation systems and operate surface radars to monitor what was happening in the waters around ships. Their training also hadn&apos;t been updated regularly to include information about new consoles and technology used to steer. </p>
<p>
     The material and the delivery methods at post-boot camp training for operations specialists have been modernized away from rote memorization to practical application, says Lt. J. Ray Norris, who runs the school at Great Lakes where new graduates get their first specialized training for the rating, known as the &quot;A,&quot; or Accession, school. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It would be like, &apos;Look at this, hold it in your memory until we test you on it on Friday.&apos; They data dumped as soon as they left here,&quot; he says. Now, 80% of the curriculum is hands-on work with simulations and interactive courseware and 20% is lectures, with more engaging lessons built around scenarios experienced in the fleet. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We all hear, this generation really loves computers,&quot; says Capt. David Dwyer, who oversees the post-boot camp training at Great Lakes. &quot;Well, they like to play games. They still don&apos;t like computer-based training.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Post-boot camp training now is more self-paced and interactive. &quot;We went from 1970s-style teaching to 2019,&quot; says Lt. Norris. The program was piloted in April, and the first class that used it graduated in May. Full implementation took place in September. Now, the goal is, sailors won&apos;t need to relearn the basics when they arrive on their ships. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re taking 18-year-olds that don&apos;t know anything about being an operations specialist, the most vital job on the ship, and in 34 days we&apos;re sending them to a destroyer,&quot; says Lt. Norris. &quot;And probably within a month of getting there, they&apos;re qualified, proficient, making recommendations to a captain during a mission.&quot; </p>
<p>
     That is no small thing. A number of reports even before the 2017 collisions had faulted the Navy for understaffing ships and overworking sailors, leading to fatigue and burnout. The understaffing stems from earlier decisions, debated fiercely inside the service, to prioritize building new ships and maintaining a heavy load of missions despite cuts to the workforce. The Navy is rethinking that approach, but major changes haven&apos;t happened. </p>
<p>
     On the ships, sailors can only take a full load of responsibilities once they are qualified, a process that can involve oral and written tests, as well as senior sailors signing off on a list of competencies. The Navy hopes its improved training will speed up that process. </p>
<p>
     It also hopes that the tighter focus on standards, resilience and fundamentals will help the service avoid collisions like those back in 2017. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We had a little cultural drift of &apos;that can never happen to me. Maybe I won&apos;t have to fight a fire on a ship,&apos; &quot; says Adm. Sands. That attitude led to complacency, he says. &quot;When you take ownership of the problem, you can start to address it,&quot; he adds. </p>

Two Navy Ships Steam to New York and Los Angeles to Help With Pandemic</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Costas Paris </pre>
<p>
     Designed to be deployed at war and treat scores of injured servicemen, the Navy&apos;s two hospital ships are steaming to New York and California to help out with the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The USNS Mercy docked in Los Angeles on Friday and USNS Comfort will dock in Manhattan on Monday to provide a combined thousands of extra beds that will be used for non-Covid-19 cases, as scores of pandemic patients swarm land-based hospitals on both U.S. coasts. </p>
<p>
     New York is particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 29,000 cases confirmed cases as of Saturday. </p>
<p>
     Built in the 1980s, the twin vessels are converted supertankers, stretching to 894 feet -- the size of three football fields. They each have a capacity of 1,000 beds, 12 operating rooms, intensive care units, a CT scanner, blood banks, full-serve pharmacies and physical-therapy facilities. </p>
<p>
     They each accommodate more than 1,000 medical staff and crew, assigned from existing naval hospitals. </p>
<p>
     While the ships are designed to deal with war injuries, they have been mainly deployed on disaster relief and humanitarian missions like the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, where they treated more than half a million people. </p>
<p>
     The Comfort was sent to the U.S. Gulf in 2005 and treated more than 1,000 patients in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and provided showers, meals and beds to relief workers after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s the time we deployed a hospital ship stateside specifically for a response to a global Pandemic,&quot; said Andr&#233; B. Sobocinski, a historian for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. </p>
<p>
     The two ships, which generally need five days to prepare for deployment, are being kept idle with skeleton crews. The Comfort&apos;s home port is in Norfolk, Va., and the Mercy&apos;s port is in San Diego. </p>

Seeking Room for Coronavirus Patients, Massachusetts Seeks to Clear Out Some Nursing Homes</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jon Kamp and Anna Wilde Mathews </pre>
<p>
     Massachusetts is asking some nursing homes to evacuate their elderly residents so the facilities can treat coronavirus patients, the newest effort to find places to treat the infected as their surging numbers begin overwhelming hospitals. </p>
<p>
     One nursing home in Worcester, the state&apos;s second-largest city, has begun moving residents to other nursing facilities in the area. The state also said it is asking other homes to become dedicated sites for coronavirus treatment by similarly transferring residents. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We understand this is not an easy thing to ask residents, families, and nursing facilities to do,&quot; state Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said in a letter to nursing facilities Friday. </p>
<p>
     Private insurers and the state&apos;s Medicaid program are coordinating to establish financing structures to support the effort, she said. </p>
<p>
     Other states have also begun eyeing nursing homes to relieve the strain on hospitals. New York told nursing homes Wednesday they are required to accept coronavirus-infected patients who are discharged from hospitals but may be still convalescing. </p>
<p>
     Indiana is considering a similar move, according to draft guidance viewed by The Wall Street Journal. State officials couldn&apos;t be reached immediately for comment. </p>
<p>
     Efforts to introduce coronavirus patients into the same facilities housing frail, vulnerable nursing-home residents have drawn strong objections from major nursing-home industry groups. Policies like New York&apos;s, industry groups say, put nursing-home residents at risk of getting infected and dying. </p>
<p>
     New York has said that protecting nursing-home residents is a priority amid the coronavirus outbreak. </p>
<p>
     The Massachusetts Senior Care Association, which represents elder-care facilities in the state, said it supported the plan there -- struck among the state, the Worcester nursing home and hospitals -- because it will keep coronavirus patients and uninfected residents apart. </p>
<p>
     Matt Salmon, chief executive of Salmon Health and Retirement, which owns the Worcester, Mass., home that is evacuating residents, said the move was anguishing, but he couldn&apos;t think of another solution that would avoid putting seniors at risk. </p>
<p>
     &quot;My worst fear is having mass outbreaks in nursing homes across the state because we are required or need to take Covid-positive residents,&quot; Mr. Salmon said in a video on Facebook. Covid-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Resident moves from the company&apos;s Beaumont Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Center in Worcester were underway over the weekend and expected to be completed by Wednesday, Mr. Salmon said. </p>
<p>
     The plan is for staff to stay on site to care for coronavirus-infected patients who are stable enough where they don&apos;t need an acute-care hospital, but still need medical help such as oxygen. </p>
<p>
     Other states are taking a different tack. Louisiana, which has a rapidly growing number of Covid-19 patients and several outbreaks in elder-care facilities, said that nursing homes generally aren&apos;t allowed to accept coronavirus-infected patients from hospitals. </p>
<p>
     Nursing homes may choose to take the patients, however, if their facilities meet certain requirements. </p>
<p>
     The American Health Care Association and AMDA, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, said in a joint statement they opposed New York&apos;s move as too dangerous for residents and preferred approaches like Louisiana&apos;s, which involves cooperation between hospitals and nursing homes. </p>
<p>
     The two industry groups said states should work with nursing homes, and could move residents to create empty facilities for coronavirus patients. </p>
<p>
     Transferring nursing-home residents can also be dangerous, said Christopher Laxton, executive director of the long-term medicine society, which represents doctors who work in nursing homes. </p>
<p>
     Covid-19 has been spreading rapidly in nursing homes, resulting in large outbreaks and deaths across the U.S. There are cases in at least 147 nursing homes, with clusters and deaths reported in elder-living facilities from Vermont to Florida, according to the federal government. </p>
<p>
     At least 37 deaths have been tied to an outbreak in one Seattle-area nursing home, Life Care Center of Kirkland. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Saturday a new outbreak in a Carroll County nursing home has infected 66 residents. </p>
<p>
     Massachusetts had 4,257 confirmed Covid-19 cases as of Saturday. </p>

The U.S. Postal Service Gets $10 Billion In the Stimulus Act. It Needs The Help. -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Al Root </pre>
<p>
     The CARES Act, the $2 trillion stimulus package signed into law on Friday, is a massive shot in the arm for a moribund economy, with payments and loan guarantees to workers, small businesses, and industries hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. The U.S. Postal Service is included in the act too -- it allows USPS to borrow up to $10 billion from the Treasury. </p>
<p>
     The government wants to ensure mail and packages keep flowing during this unprecedented period of economic pause. It&apos;s a necessary step given that logistics providers are the lifeblood of any economy. </p>
<p>
     &quot;As Americans are urged to stay home, the importance of the mail will only grow as people will need access to communications and essential packages such as prescription drugs and other necessities,&quot; the USPS said in a statement. &quot;This is particularly true in rural and other areas.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;National post carriers are declaring force majeure, suspending service, or otherwise making significant adjustments,&quot; iDrive Logistics strategist Matthew White tells Barron&apos;s. </p>
<p>
     (Force majeure is invoked when an entity can&apos;t fulfill a contract because of unforeseeable circumstances.) </p>
<p>
     Deutsche Post (ticker: DPW. Germany), owner of DHL, for instance, recently reserved the right to modify services -- effectively declaring force majeure -- potentially delaying international shipments. One issue the lack of commercial flights which typically carry freight along with people. </p>
<p>
     That isn&apos;t the case in the U.S. &quot;Carriers in the United States are handling this crisis with relative aplomb,&quot; adds White. &quot;It is highly likely that the USPS&apos; longstanding agreement with FedEx Express could be further leveraged, as well as cargo assets of domestic airlines.&quot; </p>
<p>
     It&apos;s a difficult operating environment, to say the least. The USPS, for its part, is grateful for federal support but says it could need more. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Postal Service remains concerned that this measure will be insufficient to enable the Postal Service to withstand the significant downturn in our business that could directly result from the pandemic,&quot; a post office representative told Barron&apos;s in an emailed statement. &quot;Under a worst-case scenario, such downturn could result in the Postal Service having insufficient liquidity to continue operations.&quot; </p>
<p>
     It isn&apos;t clear how mail volumes have been impacted by the outbreak, but the USPS statement struck a very cautious tone. It&apos;s possible that with the economy slowing, volume could decrease as things like direct mail marketing decline. But letter carriers are still delivering mail -- including social security checks and medicine -- six days a week. </p>
<p>
     In recent quarters, the Postal Service lost money, but mainly because of Byzantine accounting rules that required the post office to pre-fund retiree health care benefits. All U.S. companies pre-fund pension benefits. But the USPS is the only one required to pre-fund retiree health care benefits. </p>
<p>
     Retiree health care benefits and pensions are two different things. General Electric (GE), for instance, has a large retiree pension. That isn&apos;t surprising because the company is more than 120 years old. GE has, very roughly, a $90 billion pension obligation and more than $70 billion in assets already set aside. </p>
<p>
     GE also has more than $5 billion in promised retiree benefits, but less than $300 million set aside to meet them. GE, as well as most U.S. companies, pay retiree health benefits as they are incurred. </p>
<p>
     The problem for the USPS is the prefunding requirement is a claim on cash flow. And cash -- as investors are learning these days -- is king. The USPS still generates free cash flow. Free cash flow approximates earnings, but backs out noncash expenses, such as the health care prefunding. </p>
<p>
     The loan from the stimulus package isn&apos;t a bailout. And, in normal times, the Postal Service gets no direct support from the federal government. The government says money in the CARES Act can be used for operating expenses but not to repay debt. What&apos;s more, any loans received are intended to help speed the delivery of medical products while protecting the safety of postal workers. </p>
<p>
     The post office has a universal service mandate, and it costs the same to mail a letter to a rural community as it does to mail one in densely populated urban areas. That pricing reality is one of the constant tensions the post office has to live with and manage through. The USPS doesn&apos;t get to set the price for a stamp either. Congress, effectively, does that. The USPS can negotiate rates for parcel delivery with businesses, but it&apos;s pricing situation is unique in American logistics industry. </p>
<p>
     The USPS situation bears watching, because -- along with mail being essential for the country during the pandemic -- it has implications for publicly traded players. As White points out, USPS has partnerships and competes with publicly traded players including FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS). </p>
<p>
     At this point of the pandemic, the importance of logistics is evident in the stock prices of transportation industry players. </p>
<p>
     The Russell 3000 Truckers Index -- which includes firms like Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) -- is down less than 15% year to date, better than the 24% drop of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the 21% drop of the S&amp;P 500. </p>
<p>
     UPS and FedEx have outperformed too. UPS is down 17% year to date. FedEx, on the other hand, is off 20%. </p>
<p>
     The post office, of course, isn&apos;t publicly traded. Investors don&apos;t have a chance to ask management about the state of operations. But additional support hinted at in the USPS statement could come in the form of more loans, changing accounting rules, or, perhaps, more power over pricing. </p>

March Jobs Report Unlikely to Show Full Impact of the Coronavirus Crisis</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Eric Morath and Paul Kiernan </pre>
<p>
     The March employment report will show a hit to the U.S. job market due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, but it is unlikely to show the depth of the crash because the data reflect the month&apos;s first weeks. </p>
<p>
     Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect Friday&apos;s report to show U.S. employers shed 56,000 jobs from payrolls -- snapping a record 113-month stretch of job creation -- and the unemployment rate edged up to 3.7% from a 50-year low of 3.5% in February. </p>
<p>
     Both predictions, from a survey of eight economists late last week, are far less dire than the picture drawn by the record 3.3 million Americans who filed for unemployment benefits from March 15 through 21, after many government authorities ordered closures of large swaths of the economy to stem the virus&apos;s spread. </p>
<p>
     That&apos;s because the March report, like nearly all such Labor Department employment reports, is based on surveys asking about the week or pay period that includes the 12th day of the month. A survey of households that determines the unemployment rate asked Americans if they reported to work during the week of March 8-14. If respondents were paid for a single hour of work that week -- even if they were subsequently laid off -- they are counted as employed. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the March jobs report will primarily reflect the labor market in the first two weeks of the month, when the U.S. was struggling to ramp up testing for the virus. That was before the number of virus-related infections and deaths jumped and several governors ordered nonessential businesses to close, forcing layoffs of millions of Americans, including waiters, hotel staff, auto workers and dental hygienists. </p>
<p>
     Friday&apos;s report is &quot;not going to really capture the significant damage out there that occurred,&quot; said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLC. &quot;Investors and policy makers should just throw it out. It&apos;s just a remembrance of things past.&quot; </p>
<p>
     If the shutdowns continue for a few more weeks, the April jobs report, scheduled for release May 8, could show the greatest one-month deterioration of the labor market on record. </p>
<p>
     Friday&apos;s report &quot;feels like it will be the foreshock to a bigger earthquake coming in early May,&quot; said Nick Bunker, an economist at job-search site Indeed.com. </p>
<p>
     Depending on how the pandemic evolves, the report released in May could show unemployment soaring toward double digits and more than one million jobs slashed. That would mark the largest one-month drop in payrolls since Japan surrendered to the U.S. in September 1945, prompting the country to wind down its wartime efforts. </p>
<p>
     Future jobs reports could be even worse. </p>
<p>
     A general rule of thumb, Mr. Brusuelas said, is that the unemployment rate rises by 1 percentage point for every 1.5 million initial jobless claims. Given last week&apos;s record-shattering unemployment claims, the jobless rate will likely approach at least 6% in April and exceed 10% by midsummer, Mr. Brusuelas said, adding the numbers could keep climbing. </p>
<p>
     That&apos;s because a huge number of American workers are employed in service industries that have been shuttered. Leisure and hospitality -- a category comprising hotels, restaurants, arts and entertainment -- employed 16.9 million Americans as of February, Labor Department data show. </p>
<p>
     While millions of workers are working remotely now, just 34% of American jobs can plausibly be performed at home, University of Chicago economists Jonathan Dingel and Brent Neiman estimate. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There is the chance we could see depression-like unemployment numbers by the time we&apos;re through,&quot; Mr. Brusuelas said. </p>
<p>
     The Labor Department&apos;s survey of employers asks for their establishment&apos;s head count for the payroll period that includes March 12. If a worker was paid for any portion of that period, they are counted as being on a payroll. </p>
<p>
     Erica Groshen, the former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said underlying data in the report could give clues to the virus&apos;s emerging impact. Watch for employment cuts in temporary-help jobs and the number of hours worked. It&apos;s possible wage growth could tick up, because the first wave of job cuts hit lower-wage workers while better-paid employees were more likely to be able to work remotely -- causing the average to rise. </p>
<p>
     The coming report is also subject to unusual statistical distortions. Survey responses could be low if businesses have closed. Statistical models that smooth seasonal patterns and predict the pace at which business close and open could be rendered worthless. And some of the people who lost their jobs may be counted as out of the labor force, rather than unemployed, because they are not actively seeking work at a time when the virus has shut businesses and many are responsible for caring for children out of school or ill family members. </p>
<p>
     Some economists are bracing for a darker report on Friday. Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, forecasts the data will show 1.25 million jobs were shed and the unemployment rate jumped to 5.2%. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I know I&apos;m on the high side,&quot; he said. &quot;But the jobless-claims data tell me a lot more workers got laid off early in the month than people realized.&quot; Mr. Naroff said business closures and layoffs in hard-hit areas such as New York City occurred early enough to get counted in this report. </p>
<p>
     Like many economists, he sees the March data as the tip of the iceberg. He predicts the economy could shed upward of 10 million jobs during the pandemic and the unemployment rate will top 14%. </p>

New York Cases Top 50,000. Here&apos;s The Testing And Hospital Bed Situation. -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Al Root </pre>
<p>
     Covid-19 coronavirus numbers continue to rise. American cases topped 124,000 early Sunday morning, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. </p>
<p>
     It&apos;s the highest total for any country -- by more than 30,000 cases. Federal, state, and local government officials are acting to increase testing and hospital capacity as rapidly as possible. </p>
<p>
     New York City and the surrounding counties remain the epicenter of the American outbreak with more than 50,000 cases, nearly half the U.S. total. </p>
<p>
     So far, more than 825,000 Americans have been tested for Covid-19. Negative to positive test results are currently running about five to one. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut -- the hardest hit regions -- have carried out almost one-quarter of all tests, according to the Covid Tracking Project </p>
<p>
     The same data set reports more than 10,000 New York state hospitalizations, about two-thirds of the U.S. total. </p>
<p>
     The rising number of hospitalization highlights the need to &quot; flatten the curve.&quot; New York state has about 57,000 hospital beds in all wards. (There are about 924,000 hospital beds in 6,100 hospitals in America.) </p>
<p>
     Capacity is an issue, and officials are taking steps to mitigate the problem. The island of Manhattan, for instance, completed its first 1,000 bed temporary hospital at the Jacob Javits Convention Center Friday. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Our strategy from the beginning has been to flatten the curve and increase hospital capacity,&quot; New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a news release. &quot;We are doing things we have never done before to find more hospital beds and obtain supplies from all around the globe to ensure our health care system is not overwhelmed when the apex hits.&quot; </p>
<p>
     What&apos;s more, the U.S. Navy sent the U.S.S. Comfort hospital ship to New York from Virginia Saturday. </p>
<p>
     President Trump was in Virginia to see that ship off. The president was considering a New York region quarantine to help stop the spread, but settled on a strong travel advisory. </p>
<p>
     Covid-19 deaths now top 2,100 in the U.S. American mortality has ticked up in recent days to about 1.7%. In Italy, mortality is currently more than 10% of confirmed cases. Around the globe, Covid-19 related deaths top 31,000 with overall mortality at about 4.7% of confirmed cases. </p>
<p>
     Five countries have more than 50,000 confirmed cases including: Italy, China, Spain, and Germany, along with the U.S. Johns Hopkins reports almost 680,000 global cases. </p>

     The World Health Organization reported more than 62,000 new cases diagnosed Saturday. It&apos;s the highest number reported in the organization&apos;s daily situation reports. </p>

<p>
With Profound Sadness, Jefferies Announces Death of Jefferies Group LLC CFO, Peg Broadbent </p>
<pre>
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2020-- </pre>
<p>
  Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE: JEF) today announced with profound sadness that Peg Broadbent, the CFO of Jefferies Group LLC, has passed away from coronavirus complications. The entire Jefferies family mourns Peg&apos;s loss. On behalf of our Board of Directors, management team and all our global employees, we extend our deepest sympathies to Peg&apos;s family. </p>
<p>
  Rich Handler, our CEO, and Brian Friedman, our President, expressed their most heartfelt condolences and stated: &quot;We are heartbroken and grieve that our friend and colleague, Peg Broadbent, has passed away from coronavirus complications. Our thoughts, prayers and love go out to Peg&apos;s dear wife, Hayley, and their young children, Sebastian and Peg, as well as Peg&apos;s older children, Anna, Sophie and Charlie, and all of Peg&apos;s extended family here and in the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>
  The loss of Peg is incredibly personal for us as he was a member of our own extended family. For over a dozen years, Peg has been our CFO and partner, and helped us build Jefferies from less than half its current size, and navigate through hard times and good times. He has also been a much-loved and respected leader to the incredible global team that provides the support, foundation and glue across our firm. But Peg was so much more. Part of what made Peg the great partner he was to all of us was his core humanity. No matter what the occasion, his decency, calmness and dry wit were always there, always making things better. We will miss him terribly. </p>
<p>
  We know Peg would want his passing to serve as a reminder to all of us of how much he cared for all of his friends at Jefferies and that our priority must be the health and happiness of our loved ones. May Peg&apos;s memory be for a blessing for his family, for us and for all who loved him.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Teri Gendron, CFO of Jefferies Financial Group, has been appointed as the interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer of Jefferies Group LLC. </p>
<p>

Coronavirus Smashes Financial Adviser&apos;s &apos;Nice and Neat&apos; Work Week Into Pieces</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By John D. Stoll </pre>
<p>
     Just as Douglas Boneparth was hunkering down for self-isolation with his wife and two daughters, the Securities and Exchange Commission called. His firm, Manhattan-based Bone Fide Wealth, recently became a registered investment adviser and the government wanted an introductory audit. </p>
<p>
     This interaction is routine and within the normal course of business. The second week of March, however, was anything but normal. It was among the ugliest for stocks in history and a period of escalating concern about the new coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We were just about to quarantine, the market is just getting annihilated, and I&apos;m on the phone with a regulator,&quot; the 35-year-old financial adviser said in an interview Saturday. &quot;That&apos;s something that was completely unexpected.&quot; </p>
<p>
     It is just one of many complications the pandemic and a volatile market has dealt Mr. Boneparth. </p>
<p>
     The schedule has been scrambled. Long-term planning and portfolio reviews with clients previously took place during the traditional workday. They have been moved to evenings, after his kids are tucked into bed. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Boneparth now spends traditional business hours monitoring markets, making trades and fielding urgent calls. &quot;My weekly schedule was blocked out nice and neat,&quot; he said. &quot;All of the sudden that gets smashed into pieces.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Professionals like Mr. Boneparth set up semi-automated systems that require routine monitoring of investment allocations and portfolio mixes, but not real-time intervention. This changes in volatile times. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Boneparth now plots the market daily against its Feb. 19 peak, monitoring its performance and calculating &quot;drawdowns,&quot; or how much investments fall from their highs. Clients can tie investing strategies to the magnitude of these drawdowns. </p>
<p>
     Client acquisition -- a major driver of revenue growth -- is also on a new timetable. Mr. Boneparth has been adding dozens of clients a year and 2020 was shaping up as a record before the crisis. He currently advises 115 households on more than $50 million in investments. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The way we came out of the gate this year had me looking at a very good problem and I wondered if I had to bring on another adviser,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think that problem exists anymore.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Why? &quot;There is a massive public health crisis [that] needs to be solved before people&apos;s finances,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Marketing efforts are also sidelined. Mr. Boneparth still makes certain public appearances, and he blogs and tweets, but he doesn&apos;t have time for more formal advertising efforts -- and in-person meetings are impossible. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Boneparth cut his teeth during the 2007-09 recession, moving to New York in October 2008. He spent the decade since assembling a clientele of mostly millennials who were early in careers or in college during the financial crisis. Many have now experienced their first bear market as investors. </p>
<p>
     These clients have called to talk about how to respond, but few panic. &quot;I can count on my hand the number of people I&apos;ve had to talk down from the cliff,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Boneparth is no stranger to working from his Westfield, N.J., Tudor. A nanny is typically on duty so that Mr. Boneparth and his wife Heather, a corporate general counsel, can give their jobs adequate attention even when working from home. </p>
<p>
     On many days, however, he commuted to shared-office space at 7 World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. Before heading to New York, he&apos;d drop the kids off at day care, check emails and social media, sneak in a workout, and make an espresso. </p>
<p>
     He spent his time in the car and on the train listening to electronic music and podcasts, including &quot;Invest Like the Best&quot; and &quot;Animal Spirits.&quot; He would grab a drink at Joe Coffee before jumping on calls. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I have a very charmed commute,&quot; he said. He often broke for lunch and spent afternoons on marketing plans, writing, appearing on networks like CNBC or Fox Business, and catching up with clients or prospects. That routine is indefinitely on hold. </p>
<p>
     Now, he travels from home workspace to home workspace, often planting himself at the kitchen table, and sometimes escaping to a downstairs office that doubles as a podcast studio. Ms. Boneparth&apos;s mother is staying with the family to help while the kids are home. </p>
<p>
     The new arrangement isn&apos;t perfect. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I could have my daughter having a meltdown when the S&amp;P 500 hits a threshold and I have got to make another trade,&quot; he said. &quot;Or my wife may need an extra set of hands and the market is closing in 20 minutes.&quot; </p>

Press Release: Landmark SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED Pivotal Trial Shows Superiority for Renal Denervation in Patients with High Blood Pressure Compared to Sham Procedure</headline>
<text>
<pre>
 
   ACC.20/WCC: Study Finds Significant Blood Pressure Reductions Achieved 
with RDN in Absence of Anti-Hypertensive Medication 
 
   Medtronic Receives FDA &quot;Breakthrough Device Designation&quot; for Symplicity 
Spyral(TM) Renal Denervation System 
 
   DUBLIN, March 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --   http://www.medtronic.com/ 
Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, today 
announced first-ever clinical data from the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED Pivotal 
Trial. The prospectively powered study of patients with uncontrolled 
high blood pressure (BP) not taking anti-hypertensive medications met 
its primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints, with a &gt;99.9% 
probability of superiority for both versus those who received a sham 
control procedure. Additionally, there were no major device or 
procedural safety events through three months. The study was presented 
today as part of the American College of Cardiology together with the 
World Congress of Cardiology Scientific Sessions (ACC.20/WCC) and 
published simultaneously in The Lancet. 
 
   The global, sham-controlled study evaluated 331 patients--166 of whom 
were randomized to renal denervation (RDN), a minimally invasive 
procedure intended to regulate overactivity of nerves that lead to and 
from the kidney. Results showed a statistically significant 9.2 mm Hg 
reduction in patients&apos; office systolic blood pressure (OSBP) and 4.7 mm 
Hg reduction in 24-hour systolic ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) at 
three months in those treated with the Symplicity Spyral RDN system. 
Blood pressure reductions were sustained consistently throughout the day 
and nighttime periods, which may offer an important benefit as 
cardiovascular risk is higher during the nighttime period. 
Anti-hypertensive medications (if prescribed) were discontinued for at 
least three weeks prior to randomization. 
 
   &quot;These exciting results definitively demonstrate that RDN lowers blood 
pressure, including over the 24-hour period,&quot; said Prof. Michael 
B&#246;hm, M.D., Ph.D., chief of cardiology at the University Hospital 
Homburg/Saar in Germany. &quot;These new findings complement the broader 
SPYRAL Program further reinforcing RDN as a treatment option for 
patients with uncontrolled hypertension.&quot; 
 
   At three months, the study showed: 
 
 
   --  RDN was superior to sham in all BP measures (24-hour ABPM and Office BP, 
      systolic and diastolic). 
 
   --  RDN had significantly greater BP reductions vs. sham control in both 
      24-hour systolic ABPM (4.0 mmHg, p&lt;0.001), and office systolic BP ( 6.6 
      mmHg, p&lt;0.001). 
 
 
   &quot;As many patients with uncontrolled hypertension struggle to adhere to 
lifelong drug therapy for a variety of reasons and may look to other 
options that complement traditional treatments, we believe this advance 
could help clinicians work with patients to better manage their high 
blood pressure,&quot; said Dave Moeller, vice president and general manager 
of the Coronary and Renal Denervation business, which is part of the 
Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. &quot;Medtronic is committed to the 
field of renal denervation and in addressing the unmet need in 
hypertension management globally, and we look forward to seeing more 
insights from our industry-leading SPYRAL HTN clinical program as we 
realize the full potential of the therapy.&quot; 
 
   Medtronic also recently received Breakthrough Device Designation by the 
FDA for the Symplicity Spyral renal denervation system. The FDA 
Breakthrough Device Program is intended to help patients receive more 
timely access to certain technologies, such as renal denervation, that 
have the potential to provide more effective treatment or diagnosis for 
life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. 
 
   Hypertension is the single largest contributor to cardiovascular death; 
it dramatically increases risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, 
and kidney failure. The annual direct costs of hypertension are 
estimated at approximately $400 billion worldwide. It is estimated that 
almost 20% of patients with uncontrolled hypertension are completely 
non-adherent to oral medications, while nearly half are partially 
non-adherent, highlighting the need for alternative treatment options. 
 
   The SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED Pivotal Trial is part of the SPYRAL HTN Global 
Clinical Trial Program and accompanies the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED Trial and 
the SPYRAL DYSTAL Study. Along with the Global Symplicity Registry, 
conducted outside the United States, Medtronic&apos;s renal denervation 
program includes more than 4,000 patients, studied in the presence and 
absence of medication, and in patients with high baseline cardiovascular 
risk. Approved for commercial use in more than 60 countries around the 
world, the Symplicity Spyral system is limited to investigational use in 
the United States, Japan and Canada.

Navigating Your Life During Coronavirus</headline>
<text>
<p>
     As the coronavirus pandemic upends work, travel and home life, the rules are shifting for what people can and can&apos;t do in their daily lives. The WSJ is continuously updating advice and information on how to stay safe, healthy and connected and how to help others. Here&apos;s our latest news, answering your questions: </p>
<p>
     WORK SMARTER </p>
<p>
     A Guide to the All-Important Video Chat </p>
<p>
     With virtually everyone telecommuting, working from home is now a sartorial Wild West, with no dress code and employees juggling more responsibilities than just work. A few tips: --Ditch the tie. &quot;It would look odd for someone to show up to a Zoom meeting in a full suit and tie, &quot; says one expert. &quot;A neat button-up shirt would be an apt replacement.&quot; --Mind the wrinkles. They can be amplified on video. --Dress head-to-toe. You never know when you might have to jump up during a video call. Put on some bottoms. Read more here. Plus, how to create a professional backdrop for appearing on-screen. (Hints: The color of the wall behind you should contrast with the colors of your attire, and furniture, draperies, rugs or other soft surfaces help minimize echoing when you speak.) And Personal Tech columnist Nicole Nguyen offers advice for making the best of video happy hours, lunches with friends, reunions and other social occasions. </p>
<p>
     Tech Tips to Work From Home: Updates </p>
<p>
     Slow Wi-Fi? Incessant notifications? Slack taking over your life? You&apos;re not alone. Personal Tech columnist Joanna Stern provides solutions to readers&apos; tech problems, with new tips every day. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Put Your Old Gadgets to Work </p>
<p>
     Many electronics won&apos;t ship from Amazon until the end of April, and the coronavirus crisis has many of us rethinking our splurgey behavior anyway. With some software tweaks and low-cost cord and dongle purchases, Personal Tech columnist Joanna Stern writes, you can revive those old laptops, tablets, TVs and phones.One example: Joanna restored a 2012 iPad -- left for dead in a neighbor&apos;s attic -- to factory settings and then upgraded the operating system. It&apos;s now working as a video-chat machine. (Be sure to save photos and important stuff before resetting, and note that you might miss out on some security updates.) Other uses include a second monitor, mini TV or recipe screen for the kitchen. Read more here. </p>

<p>
     The Risks of Visits to the Grocery Store </p>
<p>
     With communities across the country virtually shut down, there is still one place nearly everyone needs to visit at some point: the grocery store. Experts say deliveries are safer, but sometimes it can be hard to get one scheduled right away. So if you must go to the store, what&apos;s the best way to navigate the aisles and crowds? We asked the experts. Among their tips: --Try to minimize visits to the store. &quot;The biggest risk factor is really being around other people,&quot; says Benjamin Chapman, a professor of food safety at North Carolina State University.--Many grocery stores are providing shoppers with wipes. If not, it&apos;s a good idea to bring your own, mainly to wipe the grocery cart. --Try to avoid exchanging money or credit cards with the cashier. Use a credit card reader when possible.--People over 65 and those who have medical conditions that put them at greater risk of hospitalization and serious illness should avoid going to the grocery store, if possible. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Answers on Home Food Delivery </p>
<p>
     As the virus keeps people away from restaurants and grocery stores, more people are turning to deliveries. We&apos;e dug into what you need to know about ordering food. Among the tips:--Ordering food is generally safer than going to a grocery store or a restaurant.--There appears to be no risk of contracting the virus by eating it in cooked food.

<p>
     How Older Adults Can Cope During the Pandemic </p>
<p>
     With the new coronavirus targeting older adults, how can they best cope and how can their adult children help them? Brian Carpenter, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., has given those questions a lot of thought. He is a geropsychologist, which means he specializes in treating older adults. He&apos;s also the son of parents ages 77 and 78. In an edited interview, Dr. Carpenter discusses how older adults can cope during the pandemic. Here are some of the questions he answered: How can you protect your parents without infantilizing them? We&apos;re going to see a lot of interesting negotiations in families about who is doing what for whom and why. Having an explicit conversation about that would be helpful. Adult children may be trying to be helpful by offering support and services. Maybe that&apos;s to protect their parents.But maybe it&apos;s also to allay their own anxiety and worry and give them a sense they are doing something helpful. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that. But they need to pause and ask, &quot;Am I doing this for my parents or for me or for both of us?&quot; Be honest about it. What about older adults who don&apos;t have family? This is a time when community -- large and small -- can step up to help support older adults who don&apos;t have family. The community in the apartment buildings where someone lives, or a next-door neighbor. The communities of social service organizations and institutions, who can identify a person in need. We have a student organization on our campus, a local chapter of &quot;Adopt a Grandparent,&quot; where students do volunteer work with residents at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Our students are no longer here in St. Louis, but the organization is talking with administrators to see how our students can send pictures of themselves, cards, letters and videos to stay in touch with them.

     Five Home Workouts to Try </p>
<p>
     Experts say it&apos;s important to still get exercise while we&apos;re hunkered down. We found these specially designed workouts you can do at home for beginners or gym rats with different amounts of space and equipment. Here&apos;s one instructor&apos;s advice for people stuck at home jonesing for yoga: Simple cross-legged position &quot;This pose teaches us to sit calmly in the entirety of the moment, even in fear,&quot; the instructor says. Place your hands on the tops of your thighs for extra grounding. Cat-cow breath Start on your hands and knees with your wrists directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips. On an inhale, lift your heart up to the ceiling, arching the back, coming into cow pose. On an exhale, round the spine into cat pose. Humble warrior Start in warrior one pose, with your right leg forward, knee bent over ankle, and left leg straight and strong behind, foot turned out to a 45-degree angle. Clasp both hands behind your lower back. As you bend your chest forward inside of your right knee, bring your arms overhead. Repeat on the opposite side. Camel Kneel with hips over knees and toes tucked (flat for more of a challenge). Place your hands on the small of your back and slowly drop your head and shoulders backward toward the wall. If comfortable, reach down to hold the heels of your feet. Reclined cobbler Lie on your back. Bend your knees, opening your thighs out to the side and bringing the soles of your feet together. Place one hand on your heart and the other hand onto your belly. Breathe here for five to seven minutes. See four other workouts here. </p>

     Answers to Your Coronavirus Health Questions: Updates </p>
<p>
     With the scale and impact of the pandemic changing daily, we&apos;re continuously answering readers&apos; health questions. Your Health columnist Sumathi Reddy tackles many more questions on how to stay healthy here. And, as the science evolves, we&apos;re updating what we know here. Today&apos;s Q&amp;A: Should parents grappling with school closures rely on grandparents for child care? This is a tough one. Older people are at the highest risk of developing serious illness and potential complications, or dying, from Covid-19. Children, meanwhile, appear to have few and sometimes no symptoms, making it hard to know if they are even infected. There&apos;s no data yet showing that children are transmitting the virus to older people but they are a large source of infection for other respiratory viruses. &quot;Is there anybody else that can potentially take care of the children?&quot; suggests Andrew Janowski, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Washington University School of Medicine and St. Louis Children&apos;s Hospital. Still, he and other experts acknowledge that for many families there may be no alternative. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the division of infectious disease at Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital in Boston, says if the family is living together and no one is commuting with the potential for outside exposure, that lessens the risk. &quot;People have to figure out a way of coping and there&apos;s not going to be an ideal solution for everybody. Presumably now that kids are going to be home there&apos;s hopefully less opportunity for them to become infected,&quot; he says. Read more here. </p>

     HELP OTHERS </p>
<p>
     How to Aid Hospitals, Doctors and Nurses </p>
<p>
     The second installment of the How You Can Help column takes a look at how regular people can help fill the medical supply gap. Among the tips:-- On the website GetUsPPE, started by a group of doctors and supported by a volunteer team of developers, designers and organizers, more than 1,500 requests for donations have been made by health-care workers across the country seeking things like N95 respirator masks, surgical masks, hand sanitizer, face shields and protective gowns.-- Hospitals have set up ways to link health-care providers with child-care assistance, and people can consider ways to support these efforts.

     --The plan provides $1,200 for each adult and $500 for each child under 17.--Almost any adult with a Social Security number qualifies, but the benefit disappears for individuals who make over $99,000 (or $198,000 for couples). Payments start phasing out for those with income above $75,000.--Advance payments will be made based on 2019 tax returns, or 2018 returns if those aren&apos;t available. The final amount of the benefits will be determined based on 2020 income and settled on the 2020 tax return.--The Internal Revenue Service could start issuing payments within three weeks.

     The Best Ways to Spend Your Stimulus Money </p>
<p>
     How should you use a one-time government rebate if you&apos;re lucky enough to have your basic living expenses covered? Spend it now to keep the economy going or hold on to it in case things get worse? Keeping some of the payment might make individual sense. If you plan to spend it, consider putting it toward sectors and workers hit hardest by the pandemic due to lockdown orders or social distancing, including buying gift cards for restaurants or paying child-care workers at the usual frequency.

     PROTECT YOURSELF </p>
<p>
     How the Coronavirus Attacks Your Body </p>
<p>
     Researchers are still studying what happens in the body when someone gets infected with the new coronavirus. But what we know about how similar respiratory viruses work, as well as recent case reports from China and Washington state, have given scientists a basic understanding of how the disease progresses:--The virus most commonly enters the nose through minuscule droplets from someone&apos;s mucus or saliva. It can also enter through the eyes or mouth.--It hijacks cells and starts replicating, ultimately producing millions of viral particles that flood the body.--Once it has attacked enough cells in the upper respiratory system, most people will start to feel symptoms.--When the cells start moving down the respiratory system into the lungs it becomes a lower respiratory illness, which is considered more serious.--When the lung becomes progressively more damaged, that triggers what is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Facts (and Myths) About Boosting Your Immune System </p>
<p>
     As the new coronavirus continues to spread, having an optimally functioning immune system is more important than ever. Your Health columnist Sumathi Reddy checked in with medical professionals, who say it&apos;s important not to rush to buy supplements and vitamins that promise to enhance your immune system. Instead, they say, stick with the more mundane, but proven, approaches:-- Keep your stress levels down. The more you stress about the virus, the more likely you are to suffer from it. Try relaxing activities, such as meditation. -- Exercise. Low- and moderate-intensity exercise naturally lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol and helps with immune-system function. But don&apos;t go overboard: Overexercise can weaken the immune system. -- Watch your diet. Stick to a healthful, balanced diet filled with lots of colorful fruits and vegetables. Foods that can help support the microbiome include plain yogurt, garlic, onion, ginger, sauerkraut and fermented foods. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     The Best Ways to Clean Your Home... </p>
<p>
     Rarely have so many people given so much thought at one time to how much they clean their homes. We have guidelines culled from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and elsewhere on the spots in your house to focus on most and mistakes to avoid. Among them:-- Make your own disinfectant wipes. You don&apos;t need to rely just on store-bought disinfectant wipes. For a homemade disinfectant, the CDC recommends mixing a quarter-cup of household chlorine bleach with one gallon of cool water.-- In the laundry room. For laundry, use detergent and bleach (for white loads) or peroxide or color-safe bleach (for colors) to kill germs.-- Don&apos;t overuse your strong cleaners. &quot;There is no need to panic-clean,&quot; one expert says. Just read the labels on everyday products to clean and disinfect the right way. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     ...and Your Phone </p>
<p>
     How high a priority should regular cleaning of your cellphone be? Three leading experts on microbiology and infectious disease who spoke with our tech columnist, Joanna Stern, say they don&apos;t do it often. Still, coronavirus can live on your phone. Stern has some basic lessons for what you can do -- and not do -- with that petri dish we all carry around. </p>
<p>
     -- Don&apos;t clean compulsively under normal circumstances. &quot;We don&apos;t need to be obsessively washing our phones right now. If people are coming into contact with coronavirus patients, then, yes. Wash your phone all the time. Not because there is evidence that it will transmit via a phone but because there is no evidence that it won&apos;t,&quot; says Dr. Emma Hayhurst, a microbiologist.-- Use a strong enough disinfectant. To effectively kill the virus on a surface, you need disinfectant solution -- for instance, something with at least 55% isopropyl alcohol. Apple and Samsung have recently endorsed this technique.-- Mind the ports. When cleaning with your disinfecting wipes, avoid getting liquid in the ports. Even if most phones are now water resistant, that resistance wears over time. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Stock Up Without Getting Fleeced </p>
<p>
     Panicked because the Purell&apos;s out? Remain calm, and heed these tips from Personal Tech columnist Nicole Nguyen. Remember: Products will eventually be back on shelves, soap can be more effective than hand sanitizer, and shipping costs sometimes exceed the price of a product, so watch out. One piece of advice: Instacart can show up-to-date information on what&apos;s in stock when other sources prove less reliable. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     What Will Coronavirus Testing and Treatment Cost Me? </p>
<p>
     In most cases, testing for the new coronavirus will not come with out-of-pocket costs. But there are some gaps. Here, we answer questions about expenses, insurance coverage and unexpected bills. --Testing is (mostly) free. New legislation will force health insurers and employers to cover lab tests for the new coronavirus and visits to health-care providers for screening. However, if a doctor does procedures or tests to rule out the virus and ends up not ordering a lab test for it, then you might still be on the hook for your copay or deductible. --Treatment is not. The new legislation does not guarantee that your health insurer will cover your treatment free of cost. For that, your typical plan rules will likely apply. --Watch out for surprise bills. You could get charged for seeking treatment at hospitals, doctors or labs that aren&apos;t in your insurer&apos;s network, as well as from out-of-network specialists who see you while you&apos;re in the hospital.

     KEEP BOREDOM AT BAY </p>
<p>
     Storytelling in the Time of Coronavirus </p>
<p>
     Award-winning author Joyce Carol Oates has this prediction about what happens to storytelling in the age of social distancing: We need stories, and we will have them. She writes: While other activities are likely to be radically changed, the reading experience is not likely to change significantly. Bookstores may be closed to live customers but are still taking orders for wares which may be mailed for no charge or, ingeniously, even picked up at curbside; e-books and audiobooks may be downloaded from public libraries. Read more here. For those wondering where to start, here are nine books out this spring. </p>

     What to Watch Now: Updates </p>
<p>
     As new and existing streaming services overwhelm viewers with choices, The Wall Street Journal is distilling the most compelling series, movies, documentaries and live events to watch at home. Each week, we&apos;ll identify a trend in streaming entertainment, and recommend releases based on a rotating series of sources.This week focuses on live streamed performances like the one that DJ D-Nice hosted on Instagram for over 100,000 fellow users. Drake, Rihanna, Mark Zuckerberg and Joe Biden virtually dropped in. Musicians John Legend and Willie Nelson are also among those who have put on live streaming performances, and name comedians like Mike Birbiglia are also getting in on the act, often for charity. --How do you know when a streaming show like that will drop? Publications covering entertainment sectors, such as Billboard and JamBase for the concert industry, are keeping schedules of daily live streams. To stay abreast of a specific performer, organization or venue, the best advice is to visit their social media accounts and sign up for alerts. --Don&apos;t miss: The WSJ&apos;s four picks to add to your queue, including the third season of the crime drama &quot;Ozark&quot; on Netflix.

     The Ins and Outs of Booking Cheap Flights and Hotels </p>
<p>
     Don&apos;t be dumb and dangerous by traveling during a pandemic just because you find a bargain-basement airfare, writes Middle Seat columnist Scott McCartney. --Domestic trips. Later in the year, ultracheap domestic deals are worth the gamble. --International trips. You&apos;ll want to wait longer because there is so much uncertainty in the airline and hotel industries -- unless you&apos;re after that impossible-to-get luxury hotel, safari or small-ship expedition for a trip in the fall or later.

After Fed Unleashes Firepower, Washington Rearms Central Bank</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Nick Timiraos </pre>
<p>
     The Federal Reserve quickly deployed a half-dozen emergency lending programs over the past two weeks to ensure cash keeps coursing through the U.S. financial system. Now, Congress wants it to go much further, approving $454 billion to reload the Fed&apos;s own ability to lend. </p>
<p>
     Washington is relying on the Fed, to an unprecedented degree in peacetime, to preserve business balance sheets after elected officials and private industry have put the economy into the equivalent of a medically induced coma to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The economic-rescue legislation President Trump signed on Friday asks the Fed to charge headlong into credit and fiscal policy, by financing businesses, states and cities. These are areas the central bank has normally regarded as matters best left to elected officials in Congress and the White House. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Congress is the Fed&apos;s boss and Congress has mandated them to lend to areas of the economy that they were previously uncomfortable doing,&quot; said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and founder of economic-advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives. </p>
<p>
     The Fed has essentially unlimited power to lend during a crisis so long as officials consider their loans well-secured. By providing the Treasury Department with a sizable pot of money, Congress has given the central bank more flexibility to ramp up lending because the Treasury will agree to absorb initial losses. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is an opportunity to leverage the unlimited balance sheet of the Fed,&quot; Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) told reporters last week. &quot;It&apos;s totally unprecedented. We&apos;re hoping that it&apos;s a mechanism to keep business alive.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The move to entrust the Fed with more responsibility marks an about-face for both Congress and Mr. Trump, who has unsparingly criticized the central bank and the man he picked to lead it, Jerome Powell, for keeping rates too high. Ten years ago, Congress curbed the very emergency-lending authorities lawmakers are now asking the Fed to use, after popular outrage over how the central bank exercised those powers following the failures of Bear Stearns Cos. and American International Group Inc. in 2008. </p>
<p>
     The Fed&apos;s longstanding reluctance to coordinate with fiscal policy dates to an accord with the Treasury Department in 1951. It was reached after the Fed overrode the Truman administration&apos;s demands to maintain pegs that had fixed yields on Treasury securities to support the economy during and after World War II. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There is a long history of coordination between the Fed, the administration, and Congress ending in a bad place,&quot; said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist now at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank. &quot;That shows how severe the situation is.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Powell, a lawyer who worked in the Treasury Department during the George H.W. Bush administration, has worked diligently during his two years as Fed chairman to meet regularly with scores of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. </p>
<p>
     By outsourcing more of the crisis response to the Fed, lawmakers are signaling both a vote of confidence in the central bank while potentially shielding themselves from blame for the difficult decisions that lie ahead, said  Mark Spindel, a Washington-based investment manager who co-wrote a book on the Fed&apos;s historical relationship with the White House and Congress. </p>
<p>
     &quot;To Jay&apos;s credit, he has worked extensively to forge that connective tissue with Congress, so the individual and the institution are seen as objective; in the best sense, technocratic; and independent of the hyper-partisanship&quot; in Washington,  said Mr. Spindel. </p>
<p>
     The Fed&apos;s initial response borrowed from the programs developed by former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who during the 2008 financial crisis broke the seal on lending authorities the Fed hadn&apos;t employed since Great Depression. </p>
<p>
     Having exhausted those off-the-shelf tools, Mr. Powell must now devise new ones, relying on the advice of British journalist Walter Bagehot, author of an 1873 book that central bankers still use as a guide for crisis management. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others,&quot; Bagehot wrote. &quot;They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to &apos;this man and that man,&apos; whenever the security is good.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Fed can&apos;t lend directly to companies but, with the approval of the Treasury secretary, it can create special facilities that extend credit. The Treasury has already kicked in $10 billion for each of five facilities, including two that will support markets for large firms&apos; debt. </p>
<p>
     The new Treasury infusions are likely to support another facility the Fed has said it will create to loan to potentially thousands of midsize businesses, likely through the banks that can borrow directly from the Fed -- a massive operational enterprise unlike anything the central bank has done. </p>
<p>
     The central bank is also looking into ways to prevent higher borrowing costs from exacerbating strains for state and local treasuries. </p>
<p>
     The real-estate industry, meanwhile, is lobbying the Fed to extend loans to thinly capitalized nonbank mortgage companies that will face distress if loan delinquencies rise. Those firms must pay investors in mortgage bonds even if borrowers fall behind on their payments. Any failure among nonbank mortgage firms could interfere with substantial efforts to keep mortgage rates low. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Many places in the capital markets, which support borrowing by households and businesses -- I&apos;m talking about mortgages and car loans and things like that -- have just stopped working,&quot; said Mr. Powell in a rare television interview last week. </p>
<p>
     &quot;So we can step in and replace that lending under our emergency lending powers,&quot; Mr. Powell said. &quot;We will do that.&quot; </p>
<p>
     As these facilities are launched, officials are likely to face tricky questions about how much further to intervene in credit markets that remain in rotten shape, especially now that they will have more funds available to take losses. Existing facilities have limited lending to the highest-rated borrowers. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Given they are constrained by how much protection they&apos;re going to get from the Treasury, the fundamental logic of limiting yourself to higher-quality assets but being able to do more is the right trade-off,&quot; said Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura Securities. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Every step you take into the riskier realm, the less you can do,&quot; Mr. Alexander said. &quot;They have to make a choice about that.&quot; </p>

After Fed Unleashes Firepower, Washington Rearms Central Bank -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Nick Timiraos </pre>
<p>
     The Federal Reserve quickly deployed a half-dozen emergency lending programs over the past two weeks to ensure cash keeps coursing through the U.S. financial system. Now, Congress wants it to go much further, approving $454 billion to reload the Fed&apos;s own ability to lend. </p>
<p>
     Washington is relying on the Fed, to an unprecedented degree in peacetime, to preserve business balance sheets after elected officials and private industry have put the economy into the equivalent of a medically induced coma to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The economic-rescue legislation President Trump signed on Friday asks the Fed to charge headlong into credit and fiscal policy, by financing businesses, states and cities. These are areas the central bank has normally regarded as matters best left to elected officials in Congress and the White House. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Congress is the Fed&apos;s boss and Congress has mandated them to lend to areas of the economy that they were previously uncomfortable doing,&quot; said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and founder of economic-advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives. </p>
<p>
     The Fed has essentially unlimited power to lend during a crisis so long as officials consider their loans well-secured. By providing the Treasury Department with a sizable pot of money, Congress has given the central bank more flexibility to ramp up lending because the Treasury will agree to absorb initial losses. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is an opportunity to leverage the unlimited balance sheet of the Fed,&quot; Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) told reporters last week. &quot;It&apos;s totally unprecedented. We&apos;re hoping that it&apos;s a mechanism to keep business alive.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The move to entrust the Fed with more responsibility marks an about-face for both Congress and Mr. Trump, who has unsparingly criticized the central bank and the man he picked to lead it, Jerome Powell, for keeping rates too high. Ten years ago, Congress curbed the very emergency-lending authorities lawmakers are now asking the Fed to use, after popular outrage over how the central bank exercised those powers following the failures of Bear Stearns Cos. and American International Group Inc. in 2008. </p>
<p>
     The Fed&apos;s longstanding reluctance to coordinate with fiscal policy dates to an accord with the Treasury Department in 1951. It was reached after the Fed overrode the Truman administration&apos;s demands to maintain pegs that had fixed yields on Treasury securities to support the economy during and after World War II. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There is a long history of coordination between the Fed, the administration, and Congress ending in a bad place,&quot; said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist now at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank. &quot;That shows how severe the situation is.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Powell, a lawyer who worked in the Treasury Department during the George H.W. Bush administration, has worked diligently during his two years as Fed chairman to meet regularly with scores of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. </p>
<p>
     By outsourcing more of the crisis response to the Fed, lawmakers are signaling both a vote of confidence in the central bank while potentially shielding themselves from blame for the difficult decisions that lie ahead, said  Mark Spindel, a Washington-based investment manager who co-wrote a book on the Fed&apos;s historical relationship with the White House and Congress. </p>
<p>
     &quot;To Jay&apos;s credit, he has worked extensively to forge that connective tissue with Congress, so the individual and the institution are seen as objective; in the best sense, technocratic; and independent of the hyper-partisanship&quot; in Washington, said Mr. Spindel. </p>
<p>
     The Fed&apos;s initial response borrowed from the programs developed by former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who during the 2008 financial crisis broke the seal on lending authorities the Fed hadn&apos;t employed since Great Depression. </p>
<p>
     Having exhausted those off-the-shelf tools, Mr. Powell must now devise new ones, relying on the advice of British journalist Walter Bagehot, author of an 1873 book that central bankers still use as a guide for crisis management. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others,&quot; Bagehot wrote. &quot;They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to &apos;this man and that man,&apos; whenever the security is good.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Fed can&apos;t lend directly to companies but, with the approval of the Treasury secretary, it can create special facilities that extend credit. The Treasury has already kicked in $10 billion for each of five facilities, including two that will support markets for large firms&apos; debt. </p>
<p>
     The new Treasury infusions are likely to support another facility the Fed has said it will create to lend to potentially thousands of midsize businesses, likely through the banks that can borrow directly from the Fed -- a massive operational enterprise unlike anything the central bank has done. </p>
<p>
     The central bank is also looking into ways to prevent higher borrowing costs from exacerbating strains for state and local treasuries. </p>
<p>
     The real-estate industry, meanwhile, is lobbying the Fed to extend loans to thinly capitalized nonbank mortgage companies that will face distress if loan delinquencies rise. Those firms must pay investors in mortgage bonds even if borrowers fall behind on their payments. Any failure among nonbank mortgage firms could interfere with substantial efforts to keep mortgage rates low. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Many places in the capital markets, which support borrowing by households and businesses -- I&apos;m talking about mortgages and car loans and things like that -- have just stopped working,&quot; said Mr. Powell in a television interview last week. </p>
<p>
     &quot;So we can step in and replace that lending under our emergency lending powers,&quot; Mr. Powell said. &quot;We will do that.&quot; </p>
<p>
     As these facilities are launched, officials are likely to face tricky questions about how much further to intervene in credit markets that remain in rotten shape, especially now that they will have more funds available to take losses. Existing facilities have limited lending to the highest-rated borrowers. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Given they are constrained by how much protection they&apos;re going to get from the Treasury, the fundamental logic of limiting yourself to higher-quality assets but being able to do more is the right trade-off,&quot; said Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura Securities. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Every step you take into the riskier realm, the less you can do,&quot; Mr. Alexander said. &quot;They have to make a choice about that.&quot; </p>

U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Could Reach 200,000, Says a Top Official -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Talal Ansari, Stella Yifan Xie and Giovanni Legorano </pre>
<p>
     The top U.S. infectious disease official warned Sunday that the new coronavirus could kill up to 200,000 Americans and sicken millions, as federal authorities issued more urgent warnings about limiting travel between New York and surrounding states. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a new federal advisory announced Saturday night urging New York City area residents not to travel to other states would help slow the virus&apos;s spread. But he said projections showed the disease would kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans and infect far more. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re going to have millions of cases,&quot; Dr. Fauci said on CNN&apos;s State of the Union program, though he cautioned that the estimates were fluid and could change. He said infection rates would begin rising outside of New York soon. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have a very difficult problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re going to see places like Detroit and other cities starting to get into trouble.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The U.S. death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the new virus reached 2,191 on Sunday, reaching nearly 700 in New York City, the American epicenter of the pandemic, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Globally the death toll quintupled over the past two weeks to 30,852 on Sunday, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins. Deaths reached nearly 10,800 in Italy. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 19,000 infections by Sunday, pushing the total to over 124,000, as the number of confirmed coronavirus infections world-wide climbed above 665,000, according to Johns Hopkins. Reported cases in New York City topped 30,000, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Fauci described &quot;intensive discussions&quot; through Saturday night over an idea President Trump floated to enforce a quarantine on New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. Ultimately, Dr. Fauci said Mr. Trump agreed to instead have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issue a &quot;strong advisory&quot; against travel to and from those states. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The reason for that is that you don&apos;t want to get to the point where you&apos;re...enforcing things that would create a bigger difficulty, morale and otherwise, when you could probably accomplish the same goal,&quot; Dr. Fauci said. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had dismissed the idea of quarantine as a &quot;federal declaration of war on states&quot; and questioned the legal basis for such measures. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo has also been critical of other states&apos; efforts to identify and track New Yorkers as they cross state lines--measures that continued on Sunday. </p>
<p>
     In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis instructed all people entering the state from the New York tri-State area to self-quarantine for 14 days. A violation could mean up to a 60 day jail sentence and fines of up to $500. </p>
<p>
     Checkpoints for vehicular traffic had been set up on Interstate 10 and 95 into the state. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think it&apos;s an issue when you have folks who are in the hot zone, then leaving the hot zone to come to different parts of the country,&quot; Mr. DeSantis said at a press conference over the weekend. He added that the passengers landing at Florida airports would be met by the National Guard and the state health authority to be screened and given instructions about self isolation. </p>
<p>
     In Rhode Island, law-enforcement officers have been scanning the state&apos;s highways for New York residents and the national guard is expected to go door-to-door in coastal communities looking for New York residents who have recently arrived. </p>
<p>
     Rhode Island Gov. Gina Riamondo issued an executive order on Saturday mandating that travelers from any state that come to Rhode Island self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Right now, we have a pinpointed risk that we need to address, and we need to be very serious and that risk is called New York City,&quot; said Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo at a news conference Friday. In a previous executive order, Ms. Raimondo targeted residents of New York state specifically. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo slammed the actions, calling it &quot;reactionary&quot; and that he would consider suing the state. &quot;I think what they did is wrong,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Many countries continued to struggle with mask supplies. In the Netherlands, health authorities recalled 600,000 masks which they had recently received from China and distributed to hospitals because they were deemed unsafe, according to Dutch broadcaster NOS. The French government said Saturday that it was organizing airlift operations to collect one billion masks it has ordered from China amid acute shortage in France. </p>
<p>
     In Italy, the government vowed to transfer EUR400 million ($446 million) to local administrations that will be used to distribute vouchers or food to needy people in a bid to head off potential riots. Italian officials warned that lockdown measures will likely be extended, as data aren&apos;t suggesting the spread of the contagion has reached its peak. </p>
<p>
     In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday warned citizens to prepare for a &quot;long-term battle.&quot; He pledged his government would roll out a stimulus package exceeding the one passed during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. Japan logged 199 new cases Saturday -- its biggest one-day jump -- bringing its total coronavirus infections to 1,724. The latest death toll was 55. </p>
<p>
     In China, officials have gradually eased the draconian restrictions in central Hubei province that have cut off the flow of goods and people for about two months. </p>
<p>
     The country&apos;s civil aviation regulator reopened domestic flights Sunday in Hubei after weeks of suspension. Flights remain suspended at the province&apos;s largest airport in Wuhan, the city where the world&apos;s first cases were reported late last year and the one worst-hit by China&apos;s Covid-19 outbreak. </p>
<p>
     Nearly all of China&apos;s large supermarkets, convenience stores and shopping malls have reopened, Wang Bin, an official with China&apos;s Ministry of Commerce, said Saturday, adding that more than 80% of restaurants and 60% of hotels have resumed business. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 45 new infections Saturday. Only one, in Henan province, was locally transmitted; the rest were imported from overseas, the commission said. </p>
<p>
     Some major Chinese cities including Shanghai continued to tighten control over international arrivals to get a handle on cases imported from abroad, which could trigger a second wave of infection domestically. </p>
<p>
     In India, the government worked to stop desperate migrant workers from leaving cities, warning they could be sent to quarantine camps and assuring that food and other staples would be provided for those who have lost jobs. The government shut down nonessential businesses and ordered people to stay home, mirroring efforts elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     Across Africa, coronavirus curfews and lockdowns have taken a violent turn as countries seek to contain the spreading virus. Confirmed cases in Africa have reached 4,282, from just around 800 a week ago. </p>
<p>
     In Kenya, police fired tear gas at a crowd who were trying to board a ferry in the port city of Mombasa on Saturday, causing a stampede in which dozens of people were injured. In Rwanda the first country to announce a lockdown in Africa, police shot two people for defying the curfews, hundreds of others have been jailed. In Uganda, police and the military are patrolling the streets, whipping taxi drivers and passengers violating the ban on public transport. </p>
<p>
     In Saudi Arabia, which has registered 1,299 coronavirus cases and eight deaths, the government suspended travel from Jeddah, the kingdom&apos;s second largest city, and imposed a curfew from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. The rest of the kingdom remains under the original curfew hours running from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. State Department said on Friday that it erred earlier this week in the number of American citizens stranded abroad, revising the total down to 33,000 from 50,000. A senior State Department official said the error was due to accounting errors that resulted in an inflated total. </p>

Mnuchin Vows Transparency in Massive Coronavirus Aid Plan</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Paul Kiernan </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sought to dispel concerns about transparency and accountability in the massive economic-relief package passed last week, though he declined to say whether the program&apos;s inspector general would be allowed to testify before Congress. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Mnuchin said on Sunday that the $2 trillion bill signed into law Friday will provide aid with &quot;full transparency&quot; to companies affected by the coronavirus pandemic and that American taxpayers will be compensated. He also vowed that the government won&apos;t pay large fees to financial firms it hires to help execute the package. </p>
<p>
     The law gives the Treasury secretary and president broad discretion to approve loans, loan guarantees and other assistance to American companies. It also calls for the appointment of a special inspector general within the Treasury Department to oversee and investigate those disbursements, a condition requested by Senate Democrats in exchange for their support. </p>
<p>
     After signing the bill into law, however, Mr. Trump said his administration &quot;will not treat&quot; the latter provision as permitting the inspector general to issue reports to Congress without &quot;presidential supervision.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In an interview Sunday with Fox News&apos; Chris Wallace, Mr. Mnuchin declined to say whether the inspector general would be allowed to testify and report to Congress. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I&apos;m going to leave that to the lawyers and to Congress to figure out,&quot; Mr. Mnuchin said. &quot;We&apos;re going to have full transparency in reporting what we&apos;re doing to the American public.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Trump administration is racing to get money authorized by the aid package to companies and workers as economists are rapidly scaling up their estimates of the economic damage likely to be wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. But the legislation&apos;s unprecedented size, and the speed with it was rushed through Congress, have fueled concerns about government officials potentially picking winners and losers among companies affected. </p>
<p>
     Last week the Federal Reserve tapped BlackRock Inc., the world&apos;s largest money manager, to steer tens of billions of dollars of asset purchases as part of an effort to shore up liquidity in credit markets. The deal&apos;s fee structure was disclosed Friday. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Any of the people who are working with us have already agreed to work at very, very, very reduced rates,&quot; Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on CBS&apos;s Face the Nation. &quot;This is a special situation, so we&apos;re not going to be paying big fees to any of these people, and we&apos;re going to make sure there aren&apos;t going to be any conflicts in any of the people we hire.&quot; </p>
<p>
     He declined to name any other financial companies the administration expects to work with. </p>
<p>
     Among other provisions, the economic package allots $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses, up to $46 billion in loans and loan guarantees from the Treasury Department for airlines and companies &quot;critical to maintaining national security,&quot; and $454 billion to support vast new lending facilities by the Fed. Critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) warned last week that the money could become a &quot;slush fund&quot; for politically connected firms without sufficient oversight. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Mnuchin said taxpayers &quot;will be fully compensated&quot; for any loans and that the government has &quot;sophisticated people we&apos;re working with&quot; to determine which companies get help. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ll look at each one of these situations,&quot; he said on CBS. &quot;Some of them are very good companies that just need liquidity and will get loans. Some of these companies may need more significant help, and we may be taking warrants or equity.&quot; </p>

Ohio Governor On Why He Ordered Early, Tough Coronavirus Lockdowns</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Joe Barrett </pre>
<p>
     Ohio had yet to report a single case of Covid-19 in early March when Gov. Mike DeWine faced a wrenching decision. </p>
<p>
     The Arnold Sports Festival, an annual weightlifting extravaganza and expo in Columbus, Ohio, was set to open. But with some 60,000 spectators a day for four days rubbing elbows with 20,000 athletes from 80 countries, local health officials were raising alarms. </p>
<p>
     On March 5, after resistance from festival organizers, the state got a court order to shut down the expo expected to start that day. It lost out on much of the $53 million in economic activity expected from the event. </p>
<p>
     For Mr. DeWine, it was the first in a series of tough calls he was forced to make between what he considers short-term economic gain and the long-term health of Ohio&apos;s residents. But in the weeks that followed, officials around the country would be grappling with similar trade-offs. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Now, it seems like kind of a no-brainer, but it was a very tough decision at the time,&quot; said Mr. DeWine, in an interview. &quot;It has a huge economic impact and people really look forward to it. But the more we looked at it, the more it looked like something that would really exacerbate the situation.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Over the last three weeks, Mr. DeWine, a Republican, has issued a series of closures -- often before harder-hit states and well ahead of the majority of his fellow governors, including many Republicans. He closed other sporting events to spectators, everything from high-school wrestling to March Madness college basketball. He shuttered schools. He restricted bars and restaurants to takeout and delivery and he canceled the state&apos;s primary via a public-health order the night before it was set to take place. Recently, he ordered residents to stay home. </p>
<p>
     On Thursday, the economic impact of those decisions began to come into focus, as the state reported 187,780 new jobless claims, the second-highest in the country and almost half the number of claims for all of last year. </p>
<p>
     So far, those figures aren&apos;t leading to second thoughts. In fact, the state says it is making progress on stemming the tide of Covid-19 infections. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve got this monster down on the mat and we&apos;re trying to keep him down. We can&apos;t let up too soon or he&apos;s coming at us,&quot; Mr. DeWine said. </p>
<p>
     Amy Acton, head of the state&apos;s Department of Health, said the clampdown on economic activity has already reduced the expected impact on the state&apos;s health system by 50% to 75%. Ohio currently has 1,137 confirmed cases, 276 hospitalizations and 19 deaths. For now, these numbers are lower than numbers from the neighboring states of Michigan and Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s not a question of if, but when we will surge and at our peak surge, &quot; Dr. Acton said. As of Friday, the state expected to see as many as 10,000 new cases a day at the peak, even with the restrictions. The peak is expected to come in early to mid-May. </p>
<p>
     Mr. DeWine said Friday that the state doesn&apos;t have a restriction on people coming in from other states, but he did urge them to self-quarantine for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Mr. DeWine, 73 years old, grew up working in his family&apos;s seed business in Yellow Springs, Ohio. He became an assistant county prosecutor in Green County, Ohio, after finishing law school and was elected county prosecutor in 1976. He went on to serve in the U.S. House, as the state&apos;s lieutenant governor, in the U.S. Senate and as state attorney general. He and his wife, Fran, had eight children, including a daughter who died in a car accident in 1993. </p>
<p>
     In one of his daily public news briefings last week and a subsequent interview, he said the economy and people&apos;s health aren&apos;t mutually exclusive considerations. </p>
<p>
     &quot;You&apos;ve got to take care of people first,&quot; he said. &quot;If people are dying at a high rate and hospitals are overflowing, that&apos;s not going to do anything for your economy.&quot; </p>
<p>
     But amid those decisions, there is still a sense that the governor is worried about whether he is making the right calls. And while he appears to be making some headway in curbing the spread of the virus, the full economic toll a shutdown will take on this swing state remains unclear. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you&apos;ve watched his press conferences, you know he&apos;s really wrestled with these decisions,&quot; said Mike Dawson, a political consultant and longtime former aide to Mr. DeWine. &quot;He&apos;s trying to do the best thing for the state no matter the political consequences.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. DeWine has earned bipartisan praise for his handling of the crisis -- and even a loyal following of people watching his folksy daily press conferences in which the grandfatherly governor thanks people for helping to &quot;bend the curve,&quot; referring to the idea that slowing the spread of the virus will prevent a catastrophic collapse of the medical system. </p>
<p>
     Last week, President Trump tweeted that he wants to see business back to usual by Easter, just a few minutes before Mr. DeWine had tweeted to Ohioans that he hopes they do the right thing and maintain social distancing. </p>
<p>
     With the expected caseload peak still at least a month away, he said it is too early to talk about easing restrictions so that people get back to work. </p>
<p>
     Some small-business owners think the governor should heed the president&apos;s advice to loosen restrictions sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>
     &quot;When I heard first about the ban, I was mad because I have 31 employees, &quot; said Pete Russell, owner of Pete&apos;s Restaurant in Canton, Ohio, which is serving takeout only. He thinks restaurants should be able to reopen after Easter, in line with President Trump. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Wash your hands, guys. Don&apos;t touch your face. If you&apos;re sick, stay home. I think our media has caused a lot of unnecessary panic.&quot; </p>

Covid-19 Could Infect Millions of Americans, Fauci Says, With Up to 200,000 Deaths -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Lisa Beilfuss </pre>
<p>
     Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday that Covid-19 was going to infect millions in the U.S. with deaths from the disease reaching reach 100,000 to 200,000. </p>
<p>
     During an interview with CNN&apos;s Jake Tapper, the nation&apos;s top infectious disease expert said restrictions on business and orders to stay home shouldn&apos;t be lifted until rapid-results testing and protective equipment for health workers is more widely available. As long as the number of cases are rising, isolation should continue, Fauci said. </p>
<p>
     The comments come as the Trump administration considers easing guidelines in the coming weeks. President Trump has suggested economic activity could resume by Easter, which is April 12. &quot;My own opinion, looking at the way things are, I doubt if that would be the case,&quot; Fauci told Tapper. &quot;We&apos;re going to be talking about it, but obviously what you see me describe, it&apos;s a little iffy there.&quot; </p>
<p>
     As of Sunday, the U.S. has reported more than 124,000 cases and more than 2,100 deaths. </p>
<p>
     Some administration officials who hit the Sunday show circuit suggested national guidelines restricting activity could remain in place until it&apos;s clear the virus is under control. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared on both &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; and CBS&apos; &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; and said a decision whether to reopen the U.S. for business as early as Easter would be a health decision and not an economic one. </p>
<p>
     A record 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance last week as shutdowns cascaded across the country. Economists only expect the number to grow. On Friday, Trump signed a $2.2 aid package with about $300 billion funding direct payments to some households. Unemployment benefits were also temporarily sweetened to provide more income and reach a broader swath of newly unemployed workers. Mnuchin on Sunday said households eligible for checks of up to $1,200 per person and $500 per child can expect direct deposits in three weeks. He also said a program to encourage small business lending would be up and running by Friday. </p>
<p>
     The new aid package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, Mnuchin said, adding that the administration would consider providing more if additional time is needed to stem the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     On ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week,&quot; White House Economic advisor Larry Kudlow meanwhile said the crisis could last eight weeks. &quot;That&apos;s what some of the science experts are telling us. I don&apos;t know if they&apos;ll be right,&quot; Kudlow said. </p>
<p>
     As the disease continues to quickly spread across the U.S., Connecticut and Oregon became the latest states where a disaster has been declared, bringing the tally to 18 states. A disaster declaration, approved by the president, makes a state eligible for federal assistance to respond to the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     After a Saturday tussle during which Trump said he was considering locking down virus hot spot New York and surrounding areas, the president backed off the threat. In an interview with CNN Saturday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said a prevention of people from moving in and out of the tri-state area would amount to a federally imposed lockdown, which he believes is illegal, and threatened to sue the federal government should it proceed with such an order. </p>
<p>
     Cuomo also threatened to sue Rhode Island after Gov. Gina Raimondo this weekend signed an executive order stopping vehicles entering the state with New York license plates. As part of the plan, the National Guard would knock on doors to identify New Yorkers and make sure they were quarantining for 14 days. Raimondo later revised the order to direct anyone entering Rhode Island from another state for a non-work-related purpose to immediately self-quarantine for 14 days. </p>

U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Could Reach 200,000, Says a Top Official -- 2nd Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Talal Ansari, Stella Yifan Xie and Giovanni Legorano </pre>
<p>
     The top U.S. infectious disease official warned Sunday that the new coronavirus could kill up to 200,000 Americans and sicken millions, as federal authorities issued more urgent warnings about limiting travel between New York and surrounding states. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a new federal advisory announced Saturday night urging New York City area residents not to travel to other states would help slow the virus&apos;s spread. But he said projections he has examined showed the disease would kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans and infect far more, &quot;looking at what we&apos;re seeing now.&quot; </p>
<p>
     He called worst-case scenario projections of more than a million U.S. deaths &quot;very, very unlikely&quot; and said any estimate could easily turn out to be wrong. He said he was certain that the number of confirmed infections would rise from the current figure of 125,000 cases reported by Johns Hopkins University. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re going to have millions of cases,&quot; Dr. Fauci said on CNN&apos;s State of the Union program. He said infection rates would begin rising outside of New York soon. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have a very difficult problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re going to see places like Detroit and other cities starting to get into trouble.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The U.S. death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the new virus reached 2,191 on Sunday, reaching nearly 700 in New York City, the American epicenter of the pandemic, according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins. Globally the death toll quintupled over the past two weeks to 30,852 on Sunday, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins. Deaths reached nearly 10,800 in Italy. </p>
<p>
     The number of confirmed coronavirus infections world-wide climbed above 665,000, according to Johns Hopkins. Reported cases in New York City topped 30,000, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Fauci described &quot;intensive discussions&quot; through Saturday night over an idea President Trump floated to enforce a quarantine on New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. Ultimately, Dr. Fauci said Mr. Trump agreed to instead have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issue a &quot;strong advisory&quot; against travel to and from those states. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The reason for that is that you don&apos;t want to get to the point where you&apos;re...enforcing things that would create a bigger difficulty, morale and otherwise, when you could probably accomplish the same goal,&quot; Dr. Fauci said. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had dismissed the idea of quarantine as a &quot;federal declaration of war on states&quot; and questioned the legal basis for such measures. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo has also been critical of other states&apos; efforts to identify and track New Yorkers as they cross state lines--measures that continued on Sunday. </p>
<p>
     In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis instructed all people entering the state from the New York tri-State area to self-quarantine for 14 days. A violation could mean up to a 60 day jail sentence and fines of up to $500. </p>
<p>
     Checkpoints for vehicular traffic had been set up on Interstate 10 and 95 into the state. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think it&apos;s an issue when you have folks who are in the hot zone, then leaving the hot zone to come to different parts of the country,&quot; Mr. DeSantis said at a press conference over the weekend. He added that the passengers landing at Florida airports would be met by the National Guard and the state health authority to be screened and given instructions about self isolation. </p>
<p>
     In Rhode Island, law-enforcement officers have been scanning the state&apos;s highways for New York residents and the national guard is expected to go door-to-door in coastal communities looking for New York residents who have recently arrived. </p>
<p>
     Rhode Island Gov. Gina Riamondo issued an executive order on Saturday mandating that travelers from any state that come to Rhode Island self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Right now, we have a pinpointed risk that we need to address, and we need to be very serious and that risk is called New York City,&quot; said Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo at a news conference Friday. In a previous executive order, Ms. Raimondo targeted residents of New York state specifically. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo slammed the actions, calling it &quot;reactionary&quot; and that he would consider suing the state. &quot;I think what they did is wrong,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Many countries continued to struggle with mask supplies. In the Netherlands, health authorities recalled 600,000 masks which they had recently received from China and distributed to hospitals because they were deemed unsafe, according to Dutch broadcaster NOS. The French government said Saturday that it was organizing airlift operations to collect one billion masks it has ordered from China amid acute shortage in France. </p>
<p>
     In Italy, the government vowed to transfer EUR400 million ($446 million) to local administrations that will be used to distribute vouchers or food to needy people in a bid to head off potential riots. Italian officials warned that lockdown measures will likely be extended, as data aren&apos;t suggesting the spread of the contagion has reached its peak. </p>
<p>
     In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday warned citizens to prepare for a &quot;long-term battle.&quot; He pledged his government would roll out a stimulus package exceeding the one passed during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. Japan logged 199 new cases Saturday -- its biggest one-day jump -- bringing its total coronavirus infections to 1,724. The latest death toll was 55. </p>
<p>
     In China, officials have gradually eased the draconian restrictions in central Hubei province that have cut off the flow of goods and people for about two months. </p>
<p>
     The country&apos;s civil aviation regulator reopened domestic flights Sunday in Hubei after weeks of suspension. Flights remain suspended at the province&apos;s largest airport in Wuhan, the city where the world&apos;s first cases were reported late last year and the one worst-hit by China&apos;s Covid-19 outbreak. </p>
<p>
     Nearly all of China&apos;s large supermarkets, convenience stores and shopping malls have reopened, Wang Bin, an official with China&apos;s Ministry of Commerce, said Saturday, adding that more than 80% of restaurants and 60% of hotels have resumed business. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 45 new infections Saturday. Only one, in Henan province, was locally transmitted; the rest were imported from overseas, the commission said. </p>
<p>
     Some major Chinese cities including Shanghai continued to tighten control over international arrivals to get a handle on cases imported from abroad, which could trigger a second wave of infection domestically. </p>
<p>
     In India, the government worked to stop desperate migrant workers from leaving cities, warning they could be sent to quarantine camps and assuring that food and other staples would be provided for those who have lost jobs. The government shut down nonessential businesses and ordered people to stay home, mirroring efforts elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     Across Africa, coronavirus curfews and lockdowns have taken a violent turn as countries seek to contain the spreading virus. Confirmed cases in Africa have reached 4,282, from just around 800 a week ago. </p>
<p>
     In Kenya, police fired tear gas at a crowd who were trying to board a ferry in the port city of Mombasa on Saturday, causing a stampede in which dozens of people were injured. In Rwanda the first country to announce a lockdown in Africa, police shot two people for defying the curfews, hundreds of others have been jailed. In Uganda, police and the military are patrolling the streets, whipping taxi drivers and passengers violating the ban on public transport. </p>
<p>
     In Saudi Arabia, which has registered 1,299 coronavirus cases and eight deaths, the government suspended travel from Jeddah, the kingdom&apos;s second largest city, and imposed a curfew from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. The rest of the kingdom remains under the original curfew hours running from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. State Department said on Friday that it erred earlier this week in the number of American citizens stranded abroad, revising the total down to 33,000 from 50,000. A senior State Department official said the error was due to accounting errors that resulted in an inflated total. </p>

Coronavirus Means Everyone Wants Jigsaw Puzzles. Good Luck Buying One.</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Michael M. Phillips </pre>
<p>
     As if things weren&apos;t bad enough, now there&apos;s a shortage of jigsaw puzzles just when we need them most. </p>
<p>
     The coronavirus pandemic has forced millions of Americans to hunker down in their homes and find ways to entertain themselves. A lot of them are thinking the same thought: jigsaw puzzle. </p>
<p>
     Of the top 10 items that shoppers searched for on Amazon.com last Tuesday, nine were antivirus cleaning supplies or personal-hygiene products (read: toilet paper). No. 7 was &quot;puzzles for adults.&quot; </p>
<p>
     More people were hunting desperately for jigsaw puzzles that day than Clorox wipes. </p>
<p>
     That should be good news for Filip Francke, chief executive of Ravensburger North America. Its parent, privately held German puzzle giant Ravensburger AG, is the world&apos;s largest purveyor of jigsaw puzzles and does $600 million in business a year in puzzles, toys and other products. </p>
<p>
     Jigsaws were on an upswing even before the coronavirus. Still, they usually reside in the afterthought zone on Amazon, ranked between 2,000 and 3,000 among search terms, according to a source familiar with the data. Even as recently as March 3, adult puzzles were just the 1,435th most-searched item, the source said. </p>
<p>
     Now, as people run through their Netflix backlog and seek an activity to share with the few people they dare get within 6 feet of, jigsaw-puzzle demand has taken off. </p>
<p>
     Ravensburger&apos;s sales in North America over the past two weeks are up 370% year-over-year, the company says. On a single day, March 26, sales were 10 times what they were a year earlier. Ravensburger is seeing Christmas numbers at Easter. </p>
<p>
     Yet 137-year-old Ravensburger finds itself with fewer ways to get puzzles to puzzlers. &quot;The demand is pretty infinite right now,&quot; says Mr. Francke. &quot;The challenge is to find ways to get it to consumers.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The world&apos;s biggest store, Amazon.com, has stopped accepting puzzle shipments in favor of household staples and medical supplies. Amazon says it plans to expand its stock as capacity permits, given &quot;extensive health and safety measures&quot; the company has adopted. But the company won&apos;t say when it will start accepting jigsaw puzzles again. </p>
<p>
     Target Corp. and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. still accept deliveries, Ravensburger says. </p>
<p>
     Barnes &amp; Noble has closed 450 out of 620 stores nationwide, but Chief Executive James Daunt says online jigsaw shoppers are making up the difference. B&amp;N salespeople will also deliver puzzles to people waiting in their cars outside of the stores. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Demand has far exceeded supply,&quot; Mr. Daunt said Sunday. &quot;We&apos;re pretty much selling it as we get it in.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Customers with time on their hands are looking for fatter books and more-complicated puzzles, Mr. Daunt says. &quot;This helps them spend time more productively and hopefully with more entertainment than Netflix and Apple TV can provide,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>
     Many small toy stores around the country have shut their doors due to health concerns or government edicts. </p>
<p>
     Sullivan&apos;s Toys &amp; Art Supplies, in Washington, D.C., doesn&apos;t allow customers inside, but will hand off puzzles curbside. About 30 times a day, a masked-and-gloved Sullivan&apos;s agent goes on a delivery run around the neighborhood to drop off toys at customers&apos; doors. Half of those deliveries include jigsaw puzzles, when they&apos;re available. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s the classic,&quot; says Natalia Alcazar, the store&apos;s general manager. &quot;You can&apos;t really beat a puzzle on any sort of day.&quot; </p>
<p>
     This weekend, though, Sullivan&apos;s stock ran down to its last adult puzzle, an intimidating, 631-piece monochrome, gold rectangle from Ravensburger&apos;s Krypt series. The store sold out of the all-silver and all-black versions earlier in the week. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve been waiting on an order,&quot; says Ms Alcazar. &quot;Right now we have no 1,000-piece, no 2,000-piece, no 5,000-piece. That&apos;s what we need right now.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Every other phone call to the store is an inquiry about puzzles, and the callers want one that&apos;s going to take a while to put together. &quot;They need something to keep the whole family occupied,&quot; Ms. Alcazar says. The only ones left on the shelves, though, are way-too-easy children&apos;s puzzles. </p>
<p>
     Ravensburger has suspended sales from its own website in order to redirect its remaining puzzle supply to Target, B&amp;N and mom-and-pop toy stores. Ravensburger says its factories in Europe are running at full capacity, and it&apos;s hoping more stock will arrive in the U.S. next month to replenish its own website and Amazon, once it reopens its warehouses to puzzle deliveries. </p>
<p>
     Secondary puzzle dealers have rushed to fill the hole in the supply chain. </p>
<p>
     The 1,000-piece &quot;Catch a Wave&quot; puzzle -- featuring a seascape with a surfer, sea turtle and dolphins -- lists for $20.99 on the Ravensburger website. A pop-up note delivers the bad news: &quot;Due to unexpected demand, we are unable to fulfill orders at this time.&quot; A Pennsylvania puzzle reseller, though, is offering &quot;Catch a Wave&quot; for $48.99 and $12.25 in shipping elsewhere online. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Dad&apos;s Shed,&quot; a nostalgic look at dad sheds in 500 large-format pieces, lists for $18.49. A reseller is offering one for $54.95 (free shipping). </p>
<p>
     &quot;Dragon Kingdom,&quot; which features half-a-dozen dragons and two castles, is on the secondary puzzle market for $46.99, plus $12.25 in shipping, a steep markup from the $20.99 (plus shipping) list price. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s really hard to find a puzzle in the market,&quot; says Mr. Francke. </p>
<p>
     The company, he suggests dryly, might have to stretch its output capacity by leaving one piece out of each puzzle. </p>

Governors Push for More Medical Gear to Fight Coronavirus</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Thomas M. Burton </pre>
<p>
     State governors, besieged by a flood of coronavirus patients amid scarce hospital resources, took to the airwaves on Sunday to plead for more equipment to fight the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Both Democratic and Republican governors highlighted acute shortages of equipment that medical professionals on the front lines need to do their jobs, including masks, gowns and face shields. One particular point of concern is the scarcity of the ventilators used to help restore breathing capability among severely stricken patients. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve put in orders with the national stockpile,&quot; said Louisiana&apos;s Republican governor, John Bel Edwards, speaking on CBS&apos;s &quot;Face the Nation.&quot; &quot;But we&apos;ve also pursued manufacturers and vendors trying to place orders for about 12,000 ventilators.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think thus far we&apos;ve received 192,&quot; Gov. Edwards said. </p>
<p>
     The criticism of the alleged weakness of federal oversight of the production and allocation of equipment has been a consistent theme in recent days. Company executives say they are ill-equipped to make decisions about which hospitals and states should first receive their medical supplies and are calling on the government to step in. </p>
<p>
     President Trump has defended his administration&apos;s work, saying that few could have expected the scope of the current pandemic and the economic fallout. </p>
<p>
     Governors were quick to acknowledge where the government was able to help in some areas. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo noted the planned arrival of the USNS Comfort, a medical ship that launched from Norfolk, Va., on Saturday and is headed to New York, where it will anchor and provide relief. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There is no state that is better prepared, or better mobilized, than what we are doing,&quot; said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, in one of his daily televised media events outlining state-wide efforts to combat the virus. </p>
<p>
     White House response coordinator Deborah Birx pointed to Gov. Cuomo&apos;s efforts to prepare as a model for the rest of the nation. &quot;We are asking every single governor and every single mayor to prepare like New York is preparing now,&quot; Dr. Birx said on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on NBC. </p>
<p>
     The governors were careful to avoid being too critical of the White House. President Trump has said he personally wouldn&apos;t engage governors and local officials who were insufficiently appreciative for what they have gotten from the federal government. </p>
<p>
     In one exchange, Mr. Trump said he told Vice President Pence, who is leading the administration&apos;s coronavirus task force, not to call Washington Gov. Jay Inslee &quot;and don&apos;t call that woman in Michigan,&quot; referring to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I don&apos;t have the energy to respond to every slight,&quot; said Gov. Whitmer, a Democrat, on CNN&apos;s &quot;State of the Union,&quot; adding that she appreciates the 112,000 masks her state&apos;s medical professionals received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There are people from the White House on down working 24/7 on behalf of the states,&quot; Gov. Whitmer said. But, she added, &quot;the dire situation in Detroit is getting worse by the minute.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Gov. Inslee also speaking on CNN, said his state faces a &quot;desperate need for testing kits&quot; and their components -- &quot;simple things like swabs.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Inslee, a Democrat, was also asked about the president&apos;s statement that he wasn&apos;t appreciative enough. &quot;As Gretchen Whitmer indicated, we&apos;re still talking with Mike Pence,&quot; Gov. Inslee said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is a serious issue across the country that we&apos;re all dealing with, &quot; said Gov. Larry Hogan, Republican of Maryland, speaking on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;I do appreciate the efforts. I hate to point fingers, we&apos;re all in this together,&quot; Mr. Hogan said. &quot;But there&apos;s also frustration out there.&quot; </p>

March Unemployment Data, Consumer Sentiment, Walgreens Earnings, and More for Investors to Watch This Week -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Nicholas Jasinski </pre>
<p>
     Several companies reporting this week could actually have positive things to say about the impact of the coronavirus and social distancing disruptions on their businesses. Conagra Brands and McCormick release quarterly results on Tuesday, followed by Lamb Weston Holdings on Wednesday. On Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Chewy report, then Constellation Brands goes on Friday. </p>
<p>
     The economic data calendar is likely to show several signs of deteriorating conditions. On Tuesday, the Conference Board releases its March Consumer Confidence Survey, which economists expect to show its lowest reading since the summer of 2017. The Institute for Supply Management&apos;s March purchasing managers&apos; indexes are forecast to show contracting economic activity. The ISM&apos;s manufacturing index is out on Wednesday, followed by the services equivalent on Friday. </p>
<p>
     Initial jobless claims for the week ending March 28 are likely to get a lot of attention this Thursday. The previous report saw the number of people applying for unemployment insurance for the first time skyrocket to a 3.3 million, the highest on record. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports March jobs data, but the figures won&apos;t be as up-to-date as the jobless claims. The survey period came before the brunt of the coronavirus disruption was felt in most parts of the U.S. Nonetheless, economists expect a loss of 125,000 jobs -- the first decline since September 2010 -- and for the unemployment rate to rise to 3.8%, from 3.5%. </p>
<p>
     Next Week </p>
<p>
     Monday 3/30 </p>
<p>
     The National Association of Realtors reports pending home sales for February. Economists forecast a 1.3% decline, after a 5.2% jump in January. The housing market had been a source of strength for the economy before the coronavirus outbreak. </p>
<p>
     The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas releases its Texas Manufacturing Survey for March. Consensus estimates are for a minus 9.5 reading, a steep drop from February&apos;s 1.2 figure. </p>
<p>
     Broadcom hosts its annual shareholder meeting. </p>
<p>
     Tuesday 3/31 </p>
<p>
     Conagra Brands and McCormick report quarterly results. </p>
<p>
     The Conference Board releases its Consumer Confidence Survey for March. Expectations are for a 110.8 reading, down from February 130.7 figure. If estimates prove correct, that would be the lowest reading since the late 2016. </p>
<p>
     The Institute for Supply Management releases its Chicago Purchasing Managers&apos; Index for March. Economists forecast a 39 reading, well below the expansionary level of 50 and down from February&apos;s 49 reading. </p>
<p>
     Wednesday 4/1 </p>
<p>
     Lamb Weston Holdings and PVH report earnings. </p>
<p>
     Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Schlumberger hold their annual shareholder meetings. </p>
<p>
     ADP releases its National Employment Report for March. Consensus estimates are for loss of 360,000 private-sector jobs. That would be the first negative monthly reading since early 2010, when the country was emerging from a recession. (This excludes a blip in September 2017, after hurricanes devastated several U.S. regions. </p>
<p>
     ISM reports its Manufacturing PMI for March. Expectations are for a 47 reading, down from 50.1 in February. </p>
<p>
     Thursday 4/2 </p>
<p>
     CarMax ,Chewy , and Walgreens Boots Alliance report quarterly results. </p>
<p>
     The Department of Labor reports initial jobless claims for the week ending on March 28. This past week, the DOL reported 3.3 million jobless claims for the week ending on March 21, the highest on record. The previous high was 695,000 claims in October 1982. More recently, jobless claims peaked at 665,000 in March 2009. </p>
<p>
     Friday 4/3 </p>
<p>
     The BLS releases the jobs report for March. Economists forecast a loss of 150,000 nonfarm jobs, the first decline since September 2010. The unemployment rate is seen rising to 3.9% from 3.5%. </p>
<p>
     Constellation Brands holds a conference call to discuss earnings. </p>
<p>
     ISM releases its Non-Manufacturing Index for March. Economists forecast a 45 reading, well below February&apos;s 57.3 figure. The last time this index had a reading below 50 was in December 2009. </p>

Economy Week Ahead: First Glimpse of Pandemic&apos;s Effect on U.S. Payrolls</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By WSJ Staff </pre>
<p>
     Economic data out this week are expected to reflect efforts to contain -- and rebound from -- the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Tuesday: China&apos;s official manufacturing index for March is expected to show factory activity has recovered notably amid the government&apos;s strong push for work resumption. </p>
<p>
     Germany releases jobless figures for March, the first large European country to do so for the month. Economists expect to see a rise in the number of people without work as some businesses scaled back, but the initial increase is forecast to be relatively modest, nudging up the unemployment rate to 5.1% from 5%. </p>
<p>
     Wednesday: The Bank of Japan&apos;s quarterly tankan corporate sentiment survey likely will show the impact of the pandemic even as disruptions in the country have been less severe than in nearby China and South Korea. </p>
<p>
     In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management&apos;s March manufacturing survey will offer an early indication of how supply-chain disruptions and business closures are affecting factory activity. ISM&apos;s release caps a full day of purchasing manager indexes from across Asia and Europe, offering some of the most timely data on the pandemic&apos;s economic fallout. </p>
<p>
     Thursday: Millions more Americans are expected to have claimed unemployment insurance benefits in the latest weekly report, underscoring the severity of job losses across the nation. </p>
<p>
     Friday: The U.S. employment report for March is expected to capture only part of the job losses that began to mount toward the end of the month. Even so, it is expected to mark the first time since 2010 that employers shed more workers than they added. </p>
<p>
     The ISM&apos;s March nonmanufacturing survey is likely to reflect the impact of canceled travel plans, closed businesses, stay-at-home orders and social distancing on U.S. service providers. </p>

America&apos;s Make-or-Break Week</headline>
<text>
<p>
     Congress has passed a $2 trillion rescue plan but before those funds start to flow, American companies from the owner of a single liquor store in Boston to corporate giants like Macy&apos;s Inc., must decide what to do about April&apos;s bills: Which obligations do they pay and which can they put off? How many employees can they afford to keep on the payroll? Can they get a break on rent? </p>
<p>
     The decisions they make this week could shape how deeply the economy is damaged by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Rent is due. Utilities are due. Credit card bills are due April 1,&quot; said Hadley Douglas, who has laid off two workers from her liquor business, The Urban Grape. &quot;The deadline is looming large and it is petrifying.&quot; She said her landlord turned down a request to temporarily pay half the rent but said to keep in touch as it was focusing first on smaller, harder hit businesses. </p>
<p>
     Millions of Americans are suddenly out of work and many businesses have already closed under orders from state and local governments to close to prevent the spread of the virus. A record 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended March 21. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. restaurant industry has lost $25 billion in sales since March 1, according to a survey of 5,000 owners by the National Restaurant Association. Nearly 50,000 stores of major U.S. retail chains have closed, according to the companies. </p>
<p>
     An estimated $20 billion in monthly retail real estate loans are due as early as this week, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap, a commercial real-estate services and consulting firm. Many retailers and restaurants have said they are not going to pay their April rents, which in turn poses a threat to the $3 trillion commercial mortgage market. </p>
<p>
     Economic activity in the U.S. and other developed countries could be lowered by a quarter, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Friday. </p>
<p>
     Companies of all sizes are feeling the squeeze, especially retailers and restaurants that have closed their doors during the outbreak. Nike Inc. is asking to pay half its rents. TJ Maxx is delaying payments to its suppliers. Victoria&apos;s Secret and Men&apos;s Wearhouse have furloughed thousands of workers. Cheesecake Factory Inc. closed 27 of the company&apos;s locations and furloughed 41,000 hourly workers, nearly 90% of its total staff. </p>
<p>
     Tyson Evans, a 23-year-old line cook for Cheesecake Factory in Indianapolis, Indiana, said he and fellow workers were stunned to learn about the furloughs. He said they believed the company would continue to employ them despite a drop in business. He is now filing for unemployment. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We keep this company going,&quot; said Mr. Evans, who is currently living with his parents and worried about paying bills including his phone, grocery and prescriptions. He has started an online petition to urge the chain to keep paying furloughed workers. </p>
<p>
     Denise Burger, a 64-year-old Cheesecake Factory server in Escondido, Calif., said she was counting on the 36 hours of work the company had scheduled for her before the furloughs came down. Ms. Burger said she&apos;s been contacting her mortgage and credit card companies to try and postpone payments. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This pandemic has put much stress and strain on me,&quot; said Ms. Burger, who is single and has worked for the company for six years in a job she loved. </p>
<p>
     California-based Cheesecake Factory said it would continue to provide health insurance for employees until June 1, and provide them a daily meal from their restaurants that remain open for take-out orders. </p>
<p>
     Cheesecake Factory has notified landlords that it won&apos;t pay April rent. &quot;Due to these extraordinary events, I am asking for your patience and, frankly, your help,&quot; wrote Chief Executive David Overton. </p>
<p>
     Owners of independent and small restaurant chains have also asked their landlords for rent relief, with mixed responses. Some say landlords are offering them deferments of several months, whereas others haven&apos;t gotten much help yet. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Landlords, if they are overly greedy, they could be losing us,&quot; said Andy Howard, chief executive of Huey Magoo&apos;s Restaurants, who is pleading for a break on rents for his Orlando, Fla., chicken tenders chain. </p>
<p>
     Residential and commercial landlords say they have been flooded with requests from individuals and businesses saying they will struggle to pay their rent for April and beyond. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I feel like I&apos;m running triage in a retail hospital out of my apartment, &quot; said Ami Ziff, director of national retail for Time Equities Inc., which owns 122 retail centers, including shopping centers, malls and street-front retail locations in 25 states. </p>
<p>
     Mortgage firms are bracing for a wave of missed payments starting April 1 as borrowers lose their jobs. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac say they will offer deferrals on home mortgages and postpone foreclosures. Auto dealers say consumers are calling to put off their April lease or loan payments. </p>
<p>
     Guy Hillel, 47 years old, got laid off from his job as a food and beverage manager at a Times Square hotel earlier this month after the property closed due to the outbreak. He is eligible for $504 a week in unemployment benefits, a fraction of what he was earning. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Hillel, who has a wife and two children, says it isn&apos;t enough to cover the family&apos;s expenses. He has called credit-card companies to negotiate payment extensions, and tried unsuccessfully to delay his monthly car loan for his family&apos;s Volkswagen Tiguan sport-utility vehicle. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s extremely stressful,&quot; Mr. Hillel said. &quot;It&apos;s crazy: I&apos;m more exhausted now than I was before when I had a job.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Hillel estimates his family will receive some stimulus money, but not the full amount awarded to couples. </p>
<p>
     The federal economic stimulus program passed last week will provide direct payments to Americans as well as loans to large and small companies. The bill includes $350 billion to help small businesses keep people on their payrolls. </p>
<p>
     For employees, it increases current unemployment benefits by $600 a week for four months. It also provides one-time checks of $1,200 to Americans with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples; individuals and couples eligible for an additional $500 per child. </p>
<p>
     Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration aims to send out direct payments to individuals in three weeks and that banks should be able to originate same-day loans for small businesses in as little as a week. </p>
<p>
     Many business owners and individuals said they have little in the way of cash reserves or savings for bills that come due in the next few days. Some wonder whether the aid will be enough. </p>
<p>
     The Small Business Administration said the stimulus bill provides &quot;small businesses with the resources they need to get them through this unprecedented time.&quot; </p>
<p>
     America&apos;s large, marquee retailers are also struggling. </p>
<p>
     Macy&apos;s Chief Executive Jeff Gennette told suppliers last week that while he had hoped to reopen stores by April 1, that was highly unlikely. &quot;While our digital business and call centers remain open, we have lost the majority of our sales,&quot; Mr. Gennette wrote in a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>
     Macy&apos;s has suspended its dividend and drawn down its credit line to bolster its cash. It has reduced pay for executives. It&apos;s also canceling some orders and has doubled the amount of time it gives itself to pay suppliers, to 120 days. Nevertheless, Mr. Gennette wrote in the letter, the retailer may need to begin furloughing some of its 130,000 employees. </p>
<p>
     Nike has offered to pay 50% rent on its 384 closed U.S. stores, landlords say, and when the stores reopen, a percentage of sales in lieu of any rent for 12 months. Nike executives said they will continue to pay workers while the stores are shut. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are currently honoring all existing contracts with our landlords. In collaboration with our real estate partners, we provided a proposal looking at near and long term approaches that we believe will help ensure both parties remain viable business partners through this unprecedented time,&quot; a Nike spokeswoman said. </p>
<p>
     Tapestry Inc., the parent of Coach and Kate Spade, extended U.S. and European store closures through April 10, but is continuing to pay store workers. &quot;What will be important as we come out the other end is to have a committed team of people,&quot; said Chief Executive Jide Zeitlin. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Zeitlin said the company is in negotiations with landlords about rent forgiveness and is looking at other expenses to cut aside from labor. </p>
<p>
     T.J. Maxx and Ross Stores Inc. have canceled orders through mid-June and are delaying payments to suppliers, according to people familiar with the situation. A T.J. Maxx spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Ross Stores didn&apos;t respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>
     Financial pressures are particularly intense for small business owners; In a typical community, about half of small businesses had less than two weeks of cash liquidity, according to a 2019 report by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. </p>
<p>
     Pennsylvania deemed auto repair an essential business, which allowed Tom Bemiller, the chief executive of The Aureus Group, to keep open his three repair shops in the Philadelphia area. Revenue is down 35% this month, he said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Customer after customer is telling us I am not going to get my car fixed until this blows over,&quot; said Mr. Bemiller. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Bemiller said hispriority is to pay his 25 employees and his suppliers. His bank is working to determine whether it can retool the terms of his company&apos;s $450,000 loan to allow for interest-only payments and has increased its credit line by $50,000, enough to cover two weeks of payroll. Pennsylvania is letting him delay certain sales tax payments; American Express Co. has agreed to waive fees and interest if he delays his $270,000 corporate credit card bill for one month. </p>

America&apos;s Make-or-Break Week -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     &quot;Right now everything is on the table because we are in survival mode,&quot; Mr. Bemiller said. &quot;We are reaching out to all vendors and creditors and asking for help and trying to delay payments as much as possible.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Bemiller has reduced his own salary. He hopes to defer payments on his mortgage, student loans, credit card bills and other expenses, but hasn&apos;t had time to work on that yet because he&apos;s been singularly focused on the business, which provides all of his family&apos;s income. </p>
<p>
     At Envision Travel Holdings Inc., a travel agency with 11 offices, revenue has fallen by two-thirds in the past month and is expected to drop to near zero in the next month or so. The Las Vegas company, which normally has 40 employees and 25 independent contractors, has laid off four workers and cut hours by 20%. </p>
<p>
     All but one of Envision&apos;s landlords has agreed to reduce rents, cutting payments to about $15,000 from $38,000, with missed payments tacked on to the end of the lease. The travel company put a hold on its 401(k) retirement savings plan and, for now, dropped its 50% contribution to the employee dental plan. &quot;We are analyzing every expense, line by line, &quot; owner Thomas Carlsen said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The universal advice we are giving tenants is don&apos;t pay your rent and see what happens,&quot; said Derek Wolman, partner at law firm Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron LLP, which often represents bars, restaurants and hotels in lease negotiations. He said this is especially true in New York state, where there is pending legislation that would give 90 days of rent forgiveness to residential and commercial tenants who suffered financially as a result of Covid-19. </p>
<p>
     In Detroit, Bedrock, a developer and property owner created by billionaire Dan Gilbert, is offering free rent to more than 100 small businesses and restaurants from April to June. &quot;Hopefully, they sense we&apos;re in it to help them,&quot; said Matt Cullen, chief executive of Bedrock. On Monday, Michigan ordered all non-essential businesses to close. </p>
<p>
     Smaller landlords who don&apos;t have enough reserves to tide them through a prolonged pause in rent collection say they are in a precarious state. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Why is the landlord the first line in bailing them out?,&quot; said Corey Bialow, a small property owner. He owns a stake in 12 properties in different states including New Jersey and Massachusetts. He said he will be on the hook for additional costs beyond mortgages such as real estate taxes, maintenance and insurance and will have to dip into his savings to pay for these. &quot;I&apos;m personally on the hook.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Coyote Hole Ciderworks, a three-year-old cider producer in Lake Anna, Va., saw an 80% drop in revenue after it was forced to shutter most of its operations. </p>
<p>
     Coyote typically employs seven workers most of the year and fifteen or more in the summer. Now, just co-owner Laura Denkers and one employee remain on the payroll; Her husband, Chris, has stopped taking a salary so the company can continue paying health insurance premiums. The Denkers&apos; 10-year-old twin sons have cystic fibrosis, which makes keeping health coverage crucial. </p>
<p>
     The couple began applying for a $60,000 disaster loan from the SBA on March 20. They said all the information they put into the system was lost when the SBA revamped the disaster loan application process because of technical difficulties. </p>
<p>
     The small company has secured a 90-day reprieve on mortgage payments from its bank; Mr. Denkers plans to pay the minimum allowed on his corporate credit card and is trying to defer payments on equipment loans and other bills. &quot;The next three weeks is the real crunch time when we need an influx of money,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Jodi Rodriguez, until recently director of retail and sales for Ovenly, a New York City-based wholesale and retail bakery that laid off all of its 72 employees, filed for unemployment March 18. </p>
<p>
     She wrote a letter to the landlord of the building she&apos;s lived in for eleven years, asking for a temporary discount on the rent on her New York apartment. Ms. Rodriguez owns a rental property in Florida, but the tenant is a make-up artist who isn&apos;t currently working. &quot;I&apos;m unsure whether she is going to pay or not,&quot; Ms. Rodriquez. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The hardest part right now is health insurance,&quot; said Ms. Rodriguez, noting that coverage through Ovenly ends March 31. </p>
<p>
     Even businesses that have had gains are facing uncertainty. Ms. Douglas, the Boston liquor store owner, said in-store sales are up 130% over what she had budgeted, more than offsetting the collapse of her catering and event business. She&apos;s keeping a close eye on cash flow and expenses, worried that she, her husband or one of their employees might get sick, that worker illnesses could disrupt her supply chain or that the state could order liquor stores to close. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Douglas is a member of a local business group in Boston&apos;s South End neighborhood that recently surveyed more than 100 small firms. Most of the owners reported revenue is down by 90% or more in March, with monthly losses totaling about $8.5 million for the 72 businesses that provided specific figures. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Every order we put in is nerve-wracking because we are so worried about getting stuck with product we can&apos;t sell,&quot; she added. &quot;We are open today but that doesn&apos;t mean we will be open next week.&quot; </p>

U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Could Reach 200,000, Says a Top Official -- 3rd Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Thomas M. Burton, Talal Ansari and Giovanni Legorano </pre>
<p>
     State governors pleaded Sunday for more equipment to fight the new coronavirus pandemic, as a flood of patients besieged hospitals and the nation&apos;s top federal disease-control official warned the American death toll could reach as high as 200,000. </p>
<p>
     Both Democratic and Republican party governors highlighted severe shortages of equipment that medical professionals on the front lines need to do their jobs, including masks, face shields and gowns. One particular point of concern is the scarcity of ventilators used to help restore breathing capability among severely stricken patients. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve put in orders with the national stockpile,&quot; said Louisiana&apos;s Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, speaking on CBS&apos;s Face the Nation. &quot;But we&apos;ve also pursued manufacturers and vendors trying to place orders for about 12,000 ventilators.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think thus far we&apos;ve received 192,&quot; Mr. Edwards said. </p>
<p>
     President Trump has defended his administration&apos;s work, saying that few could have anticipated the scope of the current pandemic and the economic fallout. And some governors have also praised aspects of the federal response, with Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo noting the arrival of a Navy hospital ship to help with the response. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The reality is that the people who need things will get what they need, &quot; said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaking on CNN&apos;s State of the Union program. </p>
<p>
     The governors raced to get more help as the U.S. death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus surged past 2,000 over the weekend, reaching 2,381 by Sunday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 700 of the deaths were in New York City, the American epicenter of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     Globally the death toll quintupled over the past two weeks to 30,852 on Sunday, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins. Deaths reached nearly 10,800 in Italy. </p>
<p>
     The number of confirmed American cases surpassed 132,000, the most in the world. Globally, infections world-wide climbed above 665,000. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Fauci said Sunday that projections he has examined showed the disease would kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans and infect far more &quot;looking at what we&apos;re seeing now.&quot; </p>
<p>
     He called worst-case scenario projections of more than a million U.S. deaths &quot;very, very unlikely&quot; and said any estimate could easily turn out to be wrong. He said he was certain that the number of confirmed infections would continue to rise much higher. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re going to have millions of cases,&quot; Dr. Fauci said. </p>
<p>
     He said infection rates would begin increasing outside of New York soon. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have a very difficult problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re going to see places like Detroit and other cities starting to get into trouble.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Dr. Fauci described &quot;intensive discussions&quot; through Saturday night over an idea President Trump floated to enforce a quarantine on New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. Ultimately, Dr. Fauci said Mr. Trump agreed to instead have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issue a &quot;strong advisory&quot; against travel to and from those states. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The reason for that is that you don&apos;t want to get to the point where you&apos;re...enforcing things that would create a bigger difficulty, morale and otherwise, when you could probably accomplish the same goal,&quot; Dr. Fauci said. </p>
<p>
     Other states have moved to limit the number of New Yorkers fleeing their homes there for vacation homes elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis instructed all people entering the state from the New York tri-state area to self-quarantine for 14 days. A violation could mean up to a 60 day jail sentence and fines of up to $500. </p>
<p>
     In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Riamondo issued an executive order on Saturday mandating that travelers from any state that come to Rhode Island self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. An initial executive order that specifically targeted New Yorkers was rescinded. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo has slammed measures trying to limit New Yorkers&apos; movements, calling them potentially illegal and unneighborly. </p>
<p>
     He said 965 people have died from Covid-19 in New York state, up from 728 on Saturday. The number of positive cases in the state has risen to nearly 60,000, which is still close to half of the nation&apos;s total number of confirmed cases. At least at least 8,500 people are hospitalized from complications from coronavirus in the state. </p>
<p>
     The New York governor this weekend joined other states in calling for more supplies and asking for federal coordination. He said states were trying to buy the same supplies from the same companies, bidding up the prices in the process. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Unfortunately we&apos;re competing against every other state in the United States for these same things,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said Sunday. </p>
<p>
     Many countries continued to struggle with mask supplies. In the Netherlands, health authorities recalled 600,000 masks which they had recently received from China and distributed to hospitals because they were deemed unsafe, according to Dutch broadcaster NOS. The French government said Saturday that it was organizing airlift operations to collect masks it has ordered from China amid acute shortage in France. </p>
<p>
     In Italy, the government vowed to transfer EUR400 million ($446 million) to local administrations that will be used to distribute vouchers or food to needy people in a bid to head off potential riots. Italian officials warned that lockdown measures will likely be extended, as data aren&apos;t suggesting the spread of the contagion has reached its peak. </p>
<p>
     In Russia, Moscow authorities ordered an indefinite citywide quarantine, compelling all residents to remain in their homes. The stricter measures came as the city reported 1,014 infection cases out of a nationwide total of 1,534. Eight deaths have been attributed to the illness in Russia. </p>
<p>
     In China, officials have gradually eased the draconian restrictions in central Hubei province that have cut off the flow of goods and people for about two months. </p>
<p>
     The country&apos;s civil aviation regulator reopened domestic flights Sunday in Hubei after weeks of suspension. Flights remain suspended at the province&apos;s largest airport in Wuhan, the city where the world&apos;s first cases were reported late last year. </p>
<p>
     Nearly all of China&apos;s large supermarkets, convenience stores and shopping malls have reopened, Wang Bin, an official with China&apos;s Ministry of Commerce, said Saturday, adding that more than 80% of restaurants and 60% of hotels have resumed business. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 45 new infections Saturday. Only one, in Henan province, was locally transmitted; the rest were imported from overseas, the commission said. </p>
<p>
     Some major Chinese cities including Shanghai continued to tighten control over international arrivals to get a handle on cases imported from abroad, which could trigger a second wave of infection domestically. </p>
<p>
     In India, the government worked to stop desperate migrant workers from leaving cities, warning they could be sent to quarantine camps and assuring that food and other staples would be provided for those who have lost jobs. The government shut down nonessential businesses and ordered people to stay home, mirroring efforts elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     Across Africa, coronavirus curfews and lockdowns have taken a violent turn as countries seek to contain the spreading virus. Confirmed cases in Africa have reached 4,282, from just around 800 a week ago. In Kenya, police fired tear gas at a crowd who were trying to board a ferry in the port city of Mombasa on Saturday, causing a stampede in which dozens of people were injured. </p>

The 10-Point: The Wall Street Journal&apos;s Guide to the Day&apos;s Top News</headline>
<text>
<pre>
 By Matt Murray </pre>
<p>
  Good Evening, and welcome to a special edition of The 10-Point. </p>
<p>
  Doctors and governments around the world are scrambling for more medical supplies as the world-wide death toll from the pandemic passed 30,000. U.S. legislators and lobbyists are discussing the possibility of another emergency-spending package, while the Federal Reserve is preparing to charge into credit and fiscal policy that it normally leaves to elected officials. </p>
<p>
  As we track the coronavirus and shutdown, the staff of The Wall Street Journal continues to bring you regular updates and the latest information from around the world as we all navigate this challenging time. Please visit our live coverage page, which is regularly updated, and keep an eye on wsj.com for updates from around the world throughout the day. And please take care of yourselves. </p>

 </pre>
<p>
  U.S. state governors pleaded for more equipment to fight the pandemic, as a flood of patients besieged hospitals and the country&apos;s top infectious disease official, Dr. Anthony Fauci, warned that the new coronavirus could kill up to 200,000 Americans and sicken millions. Federal authorities issued more urgent warnings about limiting travel between New York and surrounding states. </p>
<p>
  The U.S. death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the new virus reached 2,191 today, with nearly 700 in New York City, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Globally the death toll quintupled over the past two weeks to 30,852, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe. </p>
<p>
  Peter Navarro, the Trump administration adviser overseeing wartime powers forcing businesses into the fight against the pandemic, said the full arsenal of measures are on the table, from raids on warehouses to compelling suppliers to retool factories. Company executives, meanwhile, say they are ill-equipped to make decisions about who should first receive their medical supplies. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
   -- The economic shutdown is testing America&apos;s safety net, with more people flocking to homeless shelters and inundating suicide hotlines. </p>
<p>
   -- The pandemic has shut businesses and pushed millions into unemployment. But bills are still due: Rent, credit card, payroll. &quot;The deadline is looming large and it is petrifying.&quot; </p>
<p>
   -- Two 30-something venture capitalists have cobbled together an operation that has become an improbable gateway to hundreds of millions of protective supplies across four continents. </p>
<p>
   -- The U.S. Navy&apos;s two hospital ships are steaming to New York City and Los Angeles to help out. Meanwhile, the Army will put some new enlistees on the payroll even before they ship out for boot camp, an unusual stopgap to maintain recruiting. </p>
<p>
   -- The first federal inmate died from the novel coronavirus, fueling concerns of an outbreak in U.S. lockups. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  Around the world, many countries continued to struggle with mask supplies. In the Netherlands, health authorities recalled 600,000 masks because they were deemed unsafe. The French government said it was organizing airlift operations to collect one billion masks ordered from China. </p>
<p>
  In Italy, the government vowed to transfer 400 million euros ($446 million) to local administrations to distribute vouchers or food in a bid to head off potential riots. In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned citizens to prepare for a &quot;long-term battle.&quot; Across Africa, confirmed cases have reached 4,282, from just around 800 a week ago. </p>
<p>
   -- Religious leaders around the globe are wrestling with constraints: Lockdowns are leading to drive-through confessions, calls to prayer at home and assembling minyans virtually. </p>
<p>
   -- Britain&apos;s tightly funded National Health Service is taking drastic action to manage a crisis that some worry will overwhelm it. </p>
<p>
   -- Hand stamps, bandannas and sidewalk chalk: India looks to low-tech coronavirus solutions. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  U.S. legislators from both parties, Trump administration officials, economists, think tanks and lobbyists are already roughing out the contours of yet another emergency-spending package-perhaps larger than last week&apos;s-to try to keep the coronavirus crisis from turning into a 21st-century Great Depression. Ideas being floated include extending the package to make benefits last longer. One item cited by both President Trump and Democratic leaders is a desire for more money to shore up state government budgets. </p>
<p>
  Congress also wants the Federal Reserve to help more. The economic-rescue legislation asks the Fed to charge headlong into credit and fiscal policy, by financing businesses, states and cities. These are areas the central bank has normally regarded as matters best left to elected officials. </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, the Trump administration has vowed to keep the stock market open, even as the pandemic and a steep selloff have led some to suggest a temporary closure could soothe frightened investors. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
   The pandemic is forcing the fastest reallocation of labor since World War II, with companies and governments mobilizing an army of idled workers into activities that are urgently needed. Around the world, former hotel, restaurant and airline staff are moving to grocers, online retailers and hospitals as parts of the economy are shuttered-and essential goods and services are strained. </p>
<p>
  Companies are also racing to overhaul customer-service operations that are ill-equipped to have employees working from home. Many customers who call the hotlines of airlines, retailers and banks, among others, encounter hourslong waits. </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, college seniors had been preparing to graduate into the hottest job market in decades. Now, graduation ceremonies are canceled, three million people have filed for unemployment and many soon-to-be graduates who don&apos;t yet have jobs are wondering whether they should even bother looking. </p>
<p>
   -- The drive-through, a nearly 90-year-old American invention, may be fast-food restaurants&apos; best shot at surviving the coronavirus lockdown. </p>

New York Extends Order Against Gatherings, Nonessential Business</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jimmy Vielkind </pre>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday said nonessential businesses must remain closed and that gatherings will be banned until April 15 as the death toll from the new coronavirus surged over the weekend. </p>
<p>
     Almost 450 people around the state died from the disease between Friday and Sunday, Mr. Cuomo said at an afternoon briefing, bringing the overall toll to 965 -- the highest for any state in the nation. The total includes a New York Police Department detective as well as several health care workers. </p>
<p>
     As of Sunday, 59,513 people were infected with the virus in the state, representing an increase of more than 7,000 in a single day. One of the new patients is Patrick Foye, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who has been working from home, the agency said in a statement. </p>
<p>
     The Democratic governor said the state was still working to increase hospital capacity in preparation for the peak of infections, which officials estimate is at least two weeks away. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said a temporary hospital was being built in part of Central Park in Manhattan and would be completed Tuesday. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo said he was extending a series of executive orders that ban gatherings of any size, keep nonessential government workers at home and close nonessential businesses past Easter, on April 12, and Passover, which begins April 8. The orders had different end dates, and are now all effective until April 15. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Density is the enemy here, for this particular time,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said. </p>
<p>
     He said restrictions had helped slow the spread of the coronavirus i n earlier hot spots, including the Westchester County city of New Rochelle. State officials said Lawrence Garbuz, a 50-year-old lawyer who was one of the first cases in the county, had been released from the hospital. </p>
<p>
     In an executive order signed Saturday, Mr. Cuomo postponed the Democratic presidential primary and several special elections from April 28 to June 23. The state also ordered that women giving birth in hospitals could be joined by a partner. Some hospital systems had previously banned visitors, even for women in labor. </p>
<p>
     The weekend also featured a back-and-forth between President Trump, Mr. Cuomo and leaders of other states over whether there should be travel restrictions on people who have been in or around New York City, site of more than half of the state&apos;s cases. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump on Saturday said he was considering an &quot;enforceable quarantine&quot; for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, but his administration instead issued a &quot;strong travel advisory&quot; for the area. Mr. Cuomo said the advisory was &quot;consistent with everything we&apos;re doing.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo last week ordered state police to stop drivers with New York license plates as they entered the state and specifically ordered New Yorkers to self-quarantine for 14 days upon entering the state. On Saturday, Ms. Raimondo signed a new executive order extending the self-quarantine requirement to people from any state. </p>
<p>
     Some upstate New York counties have told downstate residents not to travel there, even if they have second homes. Rensselaer County Executive Steve McLaughlin, a Republican, signed an order Friday requiring any visitors from New York City, Long Island, Westchester or Rockland counties to register with officials and quarantine for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you&apos;re doing this to escape New York -- you&apos;re trying to get out of a hot zone. I understand,&quot; Mr. McLaughlin said. &quot;But don&apos;t come to an area and potentially infect it. Keep the area you escaped to as safe as you can.&quot; </p>
<p>
     State lawmakers also continued talks around a state budget which must be in place by March 31. Democratic leaders of the state Assembly and Senate said Sunday they would pass resolutions allowing legislators to vote remotely. </p>
<p>
     Discussion continued about Mr. Cuomo&apos;s plan to reduce Medicaid spending by $2.5 billion, something he first proposed in January as essential to plugging a $6.1 billion deficit. </p>

Press Release: LA-Z-BOY ANNOUNCES COVID-19 ACTION PLAN</headline>
<text>
<p>
  LA-Z-BOY ANNOUNCES COVID-19 ACTION PLAN </p>
<p>
  MONROE, Mich., March 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- La-Z-Boy Incorporated (NYSE: LZB), a global leader in residential furniture, today announced its response to the COVID-19 crisis.  The company is taking the following actions based on its on-going assessment of the accelerating spread of the coronavirus and to ensure the well-being of its employees and their families, its customers and the communities where it operates: </p>
<pre>
   -- Temporary closure of its U.S. manufacturing facilities, effective 
      immediately, to be re-evaluated on April 13, 2020 
 
   -- Temporary closure of all company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries(R) 
      stores is in process, with 130 of 155 stores currently closed 
 
   -- Temporary closure of its Regional Distribution Centers once in-process 
      orders are delivered </pre>
<p>
  During this time, the company remains committed to serving its customers at La-Z-Boy.com and Joybird.com. Customers may still place orders which will be delivered when operations resume. </p>
<p>
  In light of these temporary closures, the company is taking the following measured actions to facilitate a strong ramp up once it resumes operations: </p>
<pre>
   -- The furlough of approximately 6,800 employees, or approximately 70% of 
      its global workforce 
 
   -- A salary reduction of 50% for senior management and 25% for salaried 
      employees until further notice; additionally, the board of directors will 
      forego the cash portion of its compensation until further notice 
 
   -- A freeze of the company&apos;s 401(k) match 
 
   -- Elimination of all non-essential operating expenses and capital 
      expenditures 
 
   -- Elimination of the June quarterly dividend and termination of the share 
      repurchase program indefinitely to prioritize near-term financial 
      flexibility </pre>
<p>
  In addition to almost $200 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments on hand, to strengthen its financial position and preserve liquidity, the company has proactively drawn $75 million under its $150 million revolving credit facility. </p>
<p>
  Kurt L. Darrow, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, of La-Z-Boy Incorporated, said: &quot;As we move through this unprecedented global pandemic, keeping our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate safe and healthy is of paramount importance. Throughout this period, La-Z-Boy has followed all government regulations and recommendations and implemented best-practice health and safety protocols. At this time, the company is not aware of any confirmed coronavirus cases across the enterprise and will continue our efforts to keep facilities clean and safe. However, our leadership team has determined that more significant measures are necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees, and to assist in the national effort to combat the spread of COVID-19.  We will continue to assess the evolving situation to determine the cadence to re-start operations and open stores.  During this challenging time, we will focus on managing our business to preserve cash and to ensure the continued liquidity of the company. </p>
<p>
  &quot;While the decisions made were extremely difficult and we deeply regret the impact they will have on those affected and their families, they are deemed necessary as we face one of the most challenging periods in our history.  Moving forward, with a strong financial foundation, the powerful La-Z-Boy brand, and our dedicated and hard-working people, I am confident the company will weather this storm.  Although the path forward will likely be complex and unpredictable, we expect to return to full operations when the crisis lifts, and emerge with strength,&quot; Darrow concluded. </p>
<p>
  The company plans to report its fiscal 2020 fourth-quarter and full-year results in the second half of June, and will update the investment community with more details on its various initiatives at that time. Until that time, the company undertakes no obligation to update the investment community. </p>
<p>
  La-Z-Boy remains committed to paying dividends over the long-term and will seek to resume dividends as business conditions improve. Likewise, the company will reinstate share repurchases when it deems appropriate. </p>
<p>

Needing Room for Coronavirus Patients, Massachusetts Seeks to Clear Out Some Nursing Homes -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jon Kamp and Anna Wilde Mathews </pre>
<p>
     Massachusetts is asking some nursing homes to evacuate their elderly residents so the facilities can treat coronavirus patients, the newest effort to find places to treat the infected as their surging numbers begin overwhelming hospitals. </p>
<p>
     One nursing home in Worcester, the state&apos;s second-largest city, has begun moving residents to other nursing facilities in the area. The state also said it is asking other homes to become dedicated sites for coronavirus treatment by similarly transferring residents. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We understand this is not an easy thing to ask residents, families, and nursing facilities to do,&quot; state Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said in a letter to nursing facilities Friday. </p>
<p>
     Private insurers and the state&apos;s Medicaid program are coordinating to establish financing structures to support the effort, she said. </p>
<p>
     Other states have also begun eyeing nursing homes to relieve the strain on hospitals. New York told nursing homes Wednesday they are required to accept coronavirus-infected patients who are discharged from hospitals but may be still convalescing. </p>
<p>
     Indiana has considered a similar move, according to draft guidance viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The state said its health department is working with the long-term care industry to ensure seniors are cared for during the fight against the virus. </p>
<p>
     Efforts to introduce coronavirus patients into the same facilities housing frail, vulnerable nursing-home residents have drawn strong objections from major nursing-home industry groups. Policies like New York&apos;s, industry groups say, put nursing-home residents at risk of being infected and dying. </p>
<p>
     New York has said that protecting nursing-home residents is a priority during the coronavirus outbreak. </p>
<p>
     The Massachusetts Senior Care Association, which represents elder-care facilities in the state, said it supported the plan there -- struck between the state, the Worcester nursing home and hospitals -- because it will keep coronavirus patients and uninfected residents apart. </p>
<p>
     Matt Salmon, chief executive of Salmon Health and Retirement, which owns the Worcester, Mass., home that is evacuating residents, said the move was anguishing, but he couldn&apos;t think of another solution that would avoid putting seniors at risk. </p>
<p>
     &quot;My worst fear is having mass outbreaks in nursing homes across the state because we are required or need to take Covid-positive residents,&quot; Mr. Salmon said in a video on Facebook. Covid-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Moving residents from the company&apos;s Beaumont Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Center in Worcester was underway over the weekend and expected to be completed by Wednesday, Mr. Salmon said. </p>
<p>
     The plan is for staff to stay on site to care for coronavirus-infected patients who are stable enough that they don&apos;t need an acute-care hospital but still need medical help such as oxygen. </p>
<p>
     Other states are taking a different tack. Louisiana, which has a rapidly growing number of Covid-19 patients and several outbreaks in elder-care facilities, said that nursing homes generally aren&apos;t allowed to accept coronavirus-infected patients from hospitals. </p>
<p>
     Nursing homes may choose to take the patients, however, if their facilities meet certain requirements. </p>
<p>
     The American Health Care Association and AMDA, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, said in a joint statement they opposed New York&apos;s move as too dangerous for residents and preferred approaches like Louisiana&apos;s, which involves cooperation between hospitals and nursing homes. </p>
<p>
     The two industry groups said states should work with nursing homes, and could move residents to create empty facilities for coronavirus patients. </p>
<p>
     Transferring nursing-home residents can also be dangerous, said Christopher Laxton, executive director of the long-term medicine society, which represents doctors who work in nursing homes. </p>
<p>
     Covid-19 has been spreading rapidly in nursing homes, resulting in large outbreaks and deaths across the U.S. There are cases in at least 147 nursing homes, according to the federal government, with clusters and deaths reported in elder-living facilities from Vermont to Florida. </p>
<p>
     At least 37 deaths have been tied to an outbreak in one Seattle-area nursing home, Life Care Center of Kirkland. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Saturday a new outbreak in a Carroll County nursing home has infected 66 residents. </p>
<p>
     Massachusetts had 4,257 confirmed Covid-19 cases as of Saturday. </p>

Sports Industry Reels From Coronavirus Fallout</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Ben Cohen, Joshua Robinson and Joe Flint </pre>
<p>
     The story of international sports over the past decade was one of unlimited growth, unrestrained spending and unwavering popularity. Coronavirus brought the sports business to an immediate standstill. The boom times went bust overnight. </p>
<p>
     Now, for the investors who plowed their fortunes into team ownership and the leagues that have gotten used to a gusher of money, the crisis risks turning into a reckoning. </p>
<p>
     The cancellation of the March Madness college-basketball tournament already has caused the NCAA to reduce its annual distribution to member institutions by nearly two-thirds from $600 million to $225 million. Amateur sports bodies in the U.S. tried unsuccessfully to join the congressional bailout because their losses from the delay of the Olympics could be in the range of $800 million. </p>
<p>
     Some team owners believe the biggest problem facing sports is more philosophical than financial. It is the idea that public interaction is now associated with fear. </p>
<p>
     The consequences across the business are only beginning to come into focus. Every day without sports costs the leagues and broadcasting networks huge sums of money that even savvy financial officers can&apos;t wrap their minds around. </p>
<p>
     National Basketball Association teams have closed the doors to their practice gyms, leaving the most talented players on the planet stuck in their homes with nowhere to work out, as the league office braces for an incalculable financial hit. Major League Baseball on Friday agreed to float players a $170 million advance on their salaries as they come to grips with a potentially long shutdown. The leagues are examining how to come back and play even before fans are reintroduced to the equation -- possibly ushering in an era of empty arenas as sound stages for sports broadcasts. </p>
<p>
     That might not fly with the players. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I just don&apos;t know how we can imagine a sporting event without fans,&quot; Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James said on a podcast last week. &quot;There&apos;s no excitement. There&apos;s no crying. There&apos;s no joy.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. James also balked at the concept of a neutral-site postseason with players quarantined in a bubble at the same hotel, and scoffed at the possibility of plowing ahead to the playoffs without completing the regular season. </p>
<p>
     When soccer&apos;s English Premier League shut down with Liverpool just two wins from clinching the title, team star Virgil van Dijk sounded a similar note: &quot;If we won it in an empty stadium and the fans weren&apos;t there, I&apos;d be gutted for them. No one wants to play games without the fans.&quot; </p>
<p>
     That approach hasn&apos;t worked in countries that were hit hard by the virus before the U.S. South Korea&apos;s basketball league was suspended on Feb. 29 and canceled last week, while Japan played a weekend of basketball games without spectators before deciding to cancel. The Chinese Basketball Association went dark in January and still hasn&apos;t returned. </p>
<p>
     The National Football League has been mostly spared, for now, by sheer accident of timing, but that will change if sheltering in place remains the norm or the virus is still roaring in the fall. English soccer went from beaming live games worth more than $8 billion in broadcast rights into 190 countries to zero in the space of a weekend. </p>
<p>
     The last sports domino to fall was this summer&apos;s Olympics. After weeks of wobbling, it finally tipped last week, when the International Olympic Committee begrudgingly agreed to postpone the Tokyo Games until next year. The costs of maintaining Olympic infrastructure during what could be a global recession will almost certainly tax a budget that already had swelled to $25 billion. </p>
<p>
     Media analyst Michael Nathanson forecast that if the NBA were to shut down the season and cancel the playoffs, it would cost Walt Disney Co.&apos;s ESPN and ABC $481 million and WarnerMedia&apos;s TNT $211 million in lost ad revenue -- and that comes in a season when the NBA itself was already bracing for a $400 million hit from a standoff with China over a tweet from a team executive that supported protesters in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>
     The financial effects on teams could be felt for far longer than the pandemic. Even with serious challenges to the sports-business model, including the shrinking cable-television market, the industry as a whole had grown over the last decade. Driven by skyrocketing media rights, team valuations had traveled in only one direction: up. </p>
<p>
     In no league is there a neater trend line than the NBA. The six teams sold between 2011 and May 2014 went for the average price of roughly $400 million. The four teams that have changed hands since then sold for an average of $1.85 billion. </p>
<p>
     Those astronomical valuations were driven almost completely by huge increases in the price of television rights over the past 15 years. The NFL sold its annual broadcast rights from 2007 to 2013 for an average of $1.9 billion a season. From 2014 to 2022, that number is $3.1 billion. The NBA isn&apos;t far behind, with broadcasters spending about $2.7 billion annually for the rights. </p>
<p>
     Television executives are scrambling to figure out how to protect that investment if their prized asset stays off the air. </p>
<p>
     There is widespread agreement among TV programmers that the coronavirus pandemic qualifies as an &quot;act of God&quot; and meets the requirements for a force majeure clause. But it is unlikely that TV programmers will invoke such clauses, for two reasons, according to people familiar with executives&apos; thinking. Major networks don&apos;t want to damage their relationships with leagues, which are long-running and serve as one of the few remaining linchpins for the cable bundle. And with rights deals expiring soon, including the NFL&apos;s, TV programmers are eager to preserve as much goodwill as possible going into those negotiations. </p>
<p>
     The majority of owners in the major American leagues are wealthy enough that they will be able to absorb a hit without having to dump assets. &quot;I don&apos;t think we should be having a bake sale for the owners,&quot; said former Chairman of Fox Sports David Hill. </p>
<p>
     Experts aren&apos;t expecting a fire sale of franchises valued in the billions. But for anyone who was considering cashing out in the near term, the uncertainty created by the coronavirus could be a powerful argument against it. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I don&apos;t know if there will be any inventory going forward,&quot; said Steve Horowitz, a partner at a leading sports investment bank, Inner Circle Sports. &quot;But if an NFL or NBA team came on the market tomorrow, the list of interested people would still be long -- and none of them would look back with any regret.&quot; </p>
<p>
     That could be a different story across the Atlantic, where there is so much professional soccer that many teams were clinging to survival even before the pandemic. Lower-tier clubs already have called on the lavishly funded Premier League to organize a bailout. At least a dozen teams operating on paper-thin margins could face bankruptcy without one. In a letter to club heads around Europe on Thursday, Andrea Agnelli, chairman of Italian giant Juventus, called the situation &quot;the biggest challenge our game and industry has ever faced.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are all football executives responsible for the well-being and sustainability of the clubs we manage, which are faced with a real existential threat,&quot; he said. &quot;No one is immune, and timing is of the essence.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Women&apos;s sports also could be among the biggest losers. After a banner 12 months that saw female athletes command record television audiences and make big strides in their fight for equal pay, this is the worst possible time to go dark. The U.S. women&apos;s national soccer team planned to capitalize on its 2019 World Cup victory by seizing the spotlight at the Tokyo Olympics and building a more sustainable domestic professional league. </p>
<p>
     As baseball, basketball and hockey try to figure out what the rest of 2020 looks like, so far it is business as usual for the NFL. The heavyweight American sports league struck a new long-term labor agreement with its players earlier this month and now turns its attention toward new TV deals, even though the current pacts still have a few seasons left on them. </p>
<p>
     While talks between the networks and their current rights holders are still in the preliminary stage, the NFL doesn&apos;t believe the current health crisis will have any impact on its future contracts, one network executive said. These conversations are continuing apart from the threat poised to disrupt the 2020-21 season and the potential financial impact of lost games. These rights deals are seen as post-pandemic business by the NFL -- at least for now. </p>
<p>
     One lesson of the pandemic, however, is how quickly things change. Hours after the NBA suspended its season, ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro met with the company&apos;s executives to discuss how the virus might disrupt the network&apos;s schedule. His team scrawled various hypotheticals on a white board. Could they get the rights to air WrestleMania from World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.? What about airing a seven-hour marathon of Tom Brady game footage? Was the network&apos;s new documentary on Michael Jordan ready to release early? Then, they found out the season was on hold when they read the news on their own network. </p>
<p>
     NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has spoken several times with Mr. Pitaro and WarnerMedia News and Sports Chairman Jeff Zucker since then, and some network executives are still optimistic that the NBA season can still be concluded this year. One scenario floated in conversations is the possibility of televising the NBA playoffs without spectators to protect players and fans from contracting the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban predicts there will be a premium on content from sports leagues like the NBA when there are games again. As people around the world exhaust their Netflix queues, and with the production of movies and television shows effectively shut down, he expects there will be enormous demand for something new to watch. NBA games could help solve that problem. </p>

Sports Industry Reels From Coronavirus Fallout -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     &quot;People will literally be doing anything to watch us,&quot; he said in an email. &quot;They won&apos;t even necessarily be basketball fans. They just will be starving for new content, and we will be there to feed them.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For now, the broadcasters&apos; pain is obvious in their threadbare TV schedules. CBS had been gearing up for its two showpiece events of the spring in the NCAA Tournament and the Masters. Now it is offering viewers the cold comfort of police procedurals. NBC Sports&apos; weekend schedule would normally be packed with live English soccer. Instead it aired reruns of dog shows. </p>
<p>
     The networks might have the opposite problem in the fall: too much inventory. The Kentucky Derby has been delayed from the first Saturday in May to September. The French Open was moved from June to October. The NBA playoffs could last until the late summer and overlap with the start of the NFL and college-football seasons. All that is based on speculative assumptions that severe control measures will be effective, transmission will slow in the summer and the virus won&apos;t wreak havoc in the fall. </p>
<p>
     There is a growing sense that the global sports hiatus could be an opportunity to do things differently when the games return. Some are asking whether the baseball season really needs to be 162 games long or if the NBA calendar should be pushed back two months so that it doesn&apos;t conflict with the NFL&apos;s. </p>
<p>
     One innovative idea came from Wayne Rooney, the former Manchester United forward, who proposed shifting the entire European soccer calendar to operate January to October instead of August to May for a couple of seasons. The idea would be to better line up with the next World Cup, which will be held from November 2022 in Qatar. </p>
<p>
     The shutdown of sports when Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus and the NBA suspended its season on March 11 was the moment when it hit many Americans that life was about to be very different. The restart of sports might be a signal that the worst is over and the new normal is finally about to begin. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We need sports,&quot; Mr. Cuban said, &quot;as much as sports needs fans.&quot; </p>

<p>
  This article was corrected at 8:55 ET to reflect that ESPN staffers proposed alternate programming to fill gaps left by live sports programming at a meeting after the NBA suspended its season. The original headline incorrectly said before the NBA suspended its season.</p>

Manufacturers Seek U.S. Help in Deciding Where to Ship Scarce Medical Goods</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus and Andrew Restuccia </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- Producers and distributors of medical supplies across the country are raising red flags about what they say is a lack of guidance from the federal government about where to send their products, as hospitals compete for desperately needed masks and ventilators to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     The issue is taking on greater urgency as supplies run short in hard-hit regions. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, for example, said the city could run out of supplies after a week, saying in a CNN interview the city would &quot;need a re-enforcement&quot; after that to address a crisis that is certain to last much longer. </p>
<p>
     Company executives say they are ill-equipped to make decisions about which hospitals and states should first receive their medical supplies and are calling on the government to step in. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s really the allocation piece that&apos;s most important to us right now because we just cannot and never will have a window into what the most urgent need is,&quot; said Scott Whitaker, chief executive of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade association that represents producers of medical devices. </p>
<p>
     Charlie Mills, chief executive of Medline Industries Inc., a large privately held manufacturer and distributor of medical supplies, said as the company works to ramp up its production of supplies, it is being inundated with orders. He said he would welcome the government having a &quot;strong say&quot; in how to respond. </p>
<p>
     &quot;All of our customers are wanting more,&quot; Mr. Mills said. &quot;The federal government might be in a better position to decide where it would go.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump on Sunday met with executives from about a half-dozen medical supplies producers and distributors -- including Mr. Mills -- as well as executives from United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp., to discuss how to address the shortage of supplies. </p>
<p>
     So far, the Trump administration hasn&apos;t provided the companies with formal guidance about where to distribute their products, leaving them to make such decisions on their own. Hundreds of companies last week sent a breakdown of their inventories of masks, ventilators and other medical supplies to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, and have been waiting for the agency to advise them on which areas are most urgently in need of supplies. </p>
<p>
     The White House referred a request for comment to FEMA. A spokeswoman for FEMA declined to give a timeline for when the agency would provide allocation guidance to companies. &quot;We have been able to make connections with multiple companies, but due to the large volume of response, the task force is still reading through the offers,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Hospitals across the U.S. are running out of the masks, gowns, ventilators and other equipment they need to treat patients diagnosed with coronavirus and protect staff, say hospital officials, doctors and others in the industry. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said that the state needs at least 30,000 ventilators. The Trump administration has prepared a protocol for how to split ventilators among multiple Covid-19 patients, according to two doctors working on it. </p>
<p>
     The administration has faced criticism in recent weeks from governors and health-care workers for its reluctance to make full use of the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that allows the president both to order companies to prioritize the production of certain goods and to control where those goods are distributed. </p>
<p>
     Governors have called on Mr. Trump to invoke the law to ensure not just production, but also the efficient distribution of scarce supplies to areas most in need, and to keep states from competing against each other for lifesaving equipment. </p>
<p>
     Producers and distributors of those supplies say that in the absence of guidance from the federal government, they have continued to send their regular shipments of medical supplies, without knowing whether those supplies are more urgently needed elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     The administration has broad authority to direct the allocation of such supplies. It could invoke the Defense Production Act to do so -- but some companies say the law isn&apos;t needed. They are prepared to follow the government&apos;s guidelines without the law&apos;s mandates, but so far such guidance has been scarce. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, Mr. Trump for the first time during this pandemic invoked the DPA to order General Motors Co. to sharply ramp up the production of ventilators to treat coronavirus patients, saying GM was &quot;wasting time&quot; in negotiations. GM said it already was moving to make the machines as soon as possible. The president also appointed trade adviser Peter Navarro to oversee the government&apos;s role in directing private-sector help in fighting the virus. </p>
<p>
     But the president&apos;s order to GM on Friday focused on production, not distribution. Earlier in the week, the Trump administration announced that Rear Adm. John Polowczyk would head up a supply-chain task force at FEMA intended to bolster the supply of medical equipment. He said the agency was working with companies to &quot;make better allocation decisions and understand where it is and where it needs to go.&quot; </p>
<p>
     FEMA officials told congressional committees in a telephone briefing on Wednesday that they had sought the data from distributors of medical supplies but suggested they lacked total control over whether to invoke the DPA to issue prioritization guidance to companies, saying the White House task force on coronavirus was involved in those decisions, according to a congressional aide. </p>
<p>
     On the call, administration officials said the White House had opted not to invoke the Defense Production Act to acquire and direct the distribution of supplies and equipment to certain areas because it hadn&apos;t found the need, echoing remarks by the president in recent days. When officials were asked what the administration viewed as the threshold for invoking the law, they were unable to answer, the aide said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Trump Administration&apos;s refusal to use all the tools at its disposal to get critical supplies to frontline medical workers is its latest failure to address this public health and economic crisis,&quot; said Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. </p>
<p>
     In a letter to FEMA administrator Peter Gaynor on Thursday, the head of the Health Industry Distributors Association asked the federal government to designate specific ZIP Codes, jurisdictions or care facilities as priorities to receive medical supplies. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I am writing to urge FEMA to provide the strategic direction needed to more effectively target PPE supplies based on greatest need,&quot; wrote Matthew Rowan, the association&apos;s president and CEO, referring to personal protective equipment. &quot;The private sector is not in a position to make these judgments. Only the federal government has the data and the authority to provide this strategic direction to the supply chain and the healthcare system.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;We understand prioritization is on your agenda,&quot; he added, &quot;but urge you to expedite the work.&quot; </p>
<p>
     FEMA last weekend sent a spreadsheet to producers and distributors, asking them to identify their inventory of more than two dozen types of personal protective equipment -- including N-95 masks, gloves, protective eyewear and hand sanitizer -- as well as of ventilators, inhalers, tubing sets and Food and Drug Administration-approved testing materials. Among the information FEMA sought about the companies&apos; inventory was its current location and the destination of its planned shipments. </p>
<p>
     Company executives said they didn&apos;t fault the federal government for not yet providing guidance on allocation, adding that they expected clarity soon. They said administration officials have been communicative and responsive to their concerns. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The administration has been tremendous to work with on this,&quot; Mr. Whitaker, of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, said, &quot;and I think every company would echo that.&quot; </p>

After Three Coronavirus Stimulus Packages, Congress Is Already Prepping Phase Four</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jacob M. Schlesinger and Joshua Jamerson </pre>
<p>
     As lawmakers last week completed a record-shattering economic-rescue package estimated at $2 trillion, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) predicted: &quot;This is certainly not the end of our work here in Congress -- rather the end of the beginning.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Legislators from both parties, administration officials, economists, think tanks and lobbyists are already roughing out the contours of yet another emergency-spending package -- perhaps larger than the last -- to try to keep the coronavirus crisis from turning into a 21st-century Great Depression. Many expect the debate to begin in earnest by late April. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There&apos;s talk of a multi-trillion-dollar program, given the size of the shutdown,&quot; says Stephen Moore, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. &quot;There&apos;s a general recognition that we need something big to get some juice into the economy,&quot; adds Mr. Moore, an outside economic consultant to the Trump administration and some congressional Republicans. </p>
<p>
     The ideas being floated include extending last week&apos;s package to make the benefits last longer, as well as plugging in likely holes in the hastily assembled bill. One item in particular cited by both President Trump and Democratic leaders is a desire for more money to shore up state government budgets collapsing under lost tax revenues and new spending demands. </p>
<p>
     A common theme from economists and legislators across the political spectrum: The latest measure was mainly about keeping U.S. commerce on life support while it endures a medically induced coma. That is, paying businesses and workers revenues and wages lost during the shutdown. A next phase would likely pivot from stabilization to stimulus -- providing the patient a robust regimen of physical therapy in an attempt to get the economy back to full health. </p>
<p>
     Action so far has been &quot;about mitigation,&quot; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said at a Thursday press conference. &quot;Next, we&apos;ll go from emergency mitigation to recovery...to grow the economy and create more jobs.&quot; She later called the new law &quot;a very big down payment.&quot; </p>
<p>
     As the coronavirus has ravaged U.S. business over the past month, lawmakers have reacted with uncharacteristic speed and unity to try to contain the damage. In just three weeks, a divided Congress has passed three major pieces of legislation to address the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Phase one, which President Trump signed March 3, provided $8.3 billion in fresh funds for health agencies and testing, and for small-business loan subsidies. Phase two, enacted March 18 and worth about $100 billion, had tax credits for employers offering paid sick leave, and increases to unemployment benefits and food assistance. The phase-three package of roughly $2-trillion, completed Friday, includes checks to households, bailouts for airlines and other distressed industries, and loans and grants for small business. </p>
<p>
     One question hanging over what is already being called &quot;Phase Four&quot; is whether that spirit of urgency and compromise can continue as the downturn advances. Or, will Washington return to the polarization that has often paralyzed Congress in recent years -- especially as the November elections erode incentives for cross-party cooperation? </p>
<p>
     Another concern: Legislating amid travel restrictions and the risk that more in Congress come down with the disease. </p>
<p>
     Policy makers and economists will need to assess in coming weeks whether the most recent package does enough to tide over companies and workers through the end of the shutdown -- whenever that occurs -- or whether prolonged closures require another dosage of the same medicine. </p>
<p>
     The aid in the latest measure was calculated to help small businesses cover about eight weeks of payroll. That should be sufficient if the economy largely reopens by late May. But that is still far from certain. A longer quarantine might require, at a minimum, renewal of the same assistance. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It wouldn&apos;t make a lot of sense to keep the ecosystem of commerce alive for two months, just to kill it in nine weeks by not extending that program,&quot; said Michael Strain, an economist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, who has been working with GOP lawmakers on crisis-response measures. </p>
<p>
     A bigger debate is emerging over whether Congress needs to do more, even if the disease crests by late spring. Some conservatives who supported the latest measure will likely be more hesitant about further action, worried that the crisis might turn into a permanent expansion of government intervention in the private sector. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I would hope anybody that&apos;s talking about a phase four would pause right now,&quot; House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said Friday on Fox News. &quot;Let&apos;s make sure this is actually working in the process and be smart, get the data back of where -- if -- we do need more help.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The main focus of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is on making sure the phase-three legislation is implemented properly and hasn&apos;t yet pivoted to talks regarding future stimulus packages, according to a person familiar with his thinking. </p>
<p>
     Momentum might also be slowed by the second-guessing that inevitably follows big-spending programs, especially one thrown together so quickly. &quot;My guess is that this bill won&apos;t wear well over time, and Congress isn&apos;t going to be inclined do another big package,&quot; says  Andy Laperriere, a Washington policy analyst with Cornerstone Macro, an investor advisory firm. &quot;There will be fraud, companies getting money going into bankruptcy, things that people on the left and right won&apos;t like.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Any debate over new spending will likely reopen the ideological splits that were largely papered over during the past few weeks. &quot;The left is going to want to do infrastructure, welfare payments and food stamps,&quot; says Mr. Moore. &quot;Our side will want to do tax cuts and deregulation.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Moore has discussed with administration officials and congressional Republicans the idea of suspending the payroll tax through the end of the year, which he estimates would cost about $700 billion. Mr. Trump had pushed that idea early in the crisis, but withdrew it amid bipartisan objections on Capitol Hill. </p>
<p>
     The top agenda item for many Democrats is adding to the $150 billion the just-passed law doled out to state governments. Many analysts consider that insufficient. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo branded the measure &quot;really terrible for the state of New York,&quot; saying the $4 billion his hard-hit state is slated to receive could be less than a third of the pandemic-induced budget shortfall. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We don&apos;t want states to say they can&apos;t hire teachers or anybody else because they spent all their money on the coronavirus,&quot; says Jay Shambaugh, director of the left-leaning Hamilton Project think tank and who was an economic adviser to President Obama. </p>
<p>
     At the signing ceremony for the latest bill, Mr. Trump on Friday also indicated there was White House support for further state aid &quot;because the states have been hurt very badly.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mrs. Pelosi has said in recent days she would push for free health-care coverage for coronavirus patients and more money to shore up pension funds and food stamps. Many House Democrats want more funding for the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Postal Service. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has called for funds to forgive student-loan debts, as well as increased Social Security checks to aid at-risk seniors. </p>
<p>
     Given the uncertainty of forecasts -- both around the spread of the disease and the state of the economy -- many economists want Congress to implement so-called automatic stabilizers in a next bill: payments such as enhanced unemployment insurance that would immediately kick in if the economy remains weak, without requiring new legislative approval. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The logistics of ramping up are much more complicated when you have to protect workers and consumers from a secondary outbreak,&quot; says  Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton LLP. </p>
<p>
     Many simply want more time to analyze the problem and to craft a more thoroughly vetted response. &quot;There&apos;s real interest in the next phase being more deliberate, more thoughtful, more tailored,&quot; says Steph Sterling, vice president for advocacy and policy at the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute, who has been consulting with Democrats on Capitol Hill. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There&apos;s a recognition of the optics of the scramble,&quot; Ms. Sterling says, &quot;and for more real analysis of what&apos;s needed next.&quot; </p>

States Restrict Travelers from Coronavirus &apos;Hot Zones&apos;</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jennifer Calfas and Talal Ansari </pre>
<p>
     Local governments across the country are imposing travel restrictions on people from hot-spots of the new coronavirus in the U.S., forcing them to self-isolate, stopping vehicles with out-of-state plates and urging them to stay away. </p>
<p>
     Governors in Rhode Island, Florida and Texas, among others, have tightened restrictions on out-of-state travelers. In particular, they have targeted those coming from New York, the pandemic&apos;s U.S. epicenter, and surrounding states. State leaders say the measures are needed to combat the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>
     In states like Rhode Island and Florida, state police and members of the National Guard have been pulling over out-of-state drivers, asking for their destination and ordering them to self-quarantine, among other methods used to enforce the new measures. </p>
<p>
     The number of confirmed novel coronavirus in the U.S. on Sunday surged past 135,000, tens of thousands of more than those reported in other hard-hit countries such as Italy, China and Spain. More than 59,000 of the cases come from New York. Neighboring New Jersey has reported 13,300 infections, the second-highest of any state. </p>
<p>
     President Trump had floated a quarantine on New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut, but walked back the idea Saturday. Mr. Trump cited New Yorkers fleeing to Florida as a reason for the potential measure. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They&apos;re having problems down in Florida,&quot; he said Saturday. &quot;A lot of New Yorkers going down.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Instead of a forced quarantine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new advisory urging residents from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to avoid nonessential travel for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Wendy Parmet, a public-health law professor at Northeastern University in Boston, said travel restrictions or measures at the state level can be discriminatory.She said the Constitution gives the power to regulate interstate travel and commerce to the federal government, not the states. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Each state turning into its own fortress is deeply problematic. Certainly it flies in the face of more contemporary understandings of privileges, immunities and right to travel,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s shortsighted.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last week issued an executive order directing travelers from the tri-state area to self-isolate for 14 days. A violation could mean up to a 60-day jail sentence and fines of up to $500. Checkpoints for vehicular traffic had been set up on Interstate 10 and 95 into the state. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think it&apos;s an issue when you have folks who are in the hot zone, then leaving the hot zone to come to different parts of the country,&quot; Mr. DeSantis said over the weekend. He said passengers landing at Florida airports would be met by the National Guard and the state health authority to be screened and given instructions about self isolation. </p>
<p>
     On Sunday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, ordered passengers flying to Texas from Miami, Atlanta, Detroit, Chicago, Washington state and California to quarantine for 14 days, expanding a previous order he made for travelers from New York and its surroundings and New Orleans. </p>
<p>
     He also expanded restrictions on travelers by road from any part of Louisiana. Mr. Abbott&apos;s order last week said thee measures would be enforced by the state&apos;s Department of Public Safety. Officials would conduct unannounced visits during the 14-day period to designated quarantine sites, like homes or hotels, to ensure those under quarantine orders are complying. Anyone who fails to do so could receive a fine of up to $1,000, 180 days in jail, or both. </p>
<p>
     Rhode Island Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo issued an executive order Saturday mandating that out-of-state visitors self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. A previous executive order targeted residents of New York state specifically. The National Guard will help ensure compliance. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The procedure we have in place does not violate anyone&apos;s Constitutional rights,&quot; said Col. James Manni, head of the Rhode Island State Police, at a press briefing Sunday. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been critical of other states&apos; efforts to identify and track New Yorkers as they cross state lines. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, slammed Rhode Island&apos;s initial order, calling it &quot;reactionary&quot; and that he would consider suing the state. On Sunday, he thanked Ms. Raimondo for reconsidering. </p>

Introducing Barron&apos;s Streetwise, a Podcast About Wall Street Like You&apos;ve Never Heard Before -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jack Hough </pre>
<p>
     Thank you to everyone who has subscribed to my new podcast, Barron&apos;s Streetwise , named for the column I write in Barron&apos;s. The first episode focuses on the search for a treatment for Covid-19. It also touches on what to do about the recent stock market downturn. </p>
<p>
     My Streetwise columns typically discuss things like stocks, interest rates, and Wall Street absurdities. Sometimes I include personal adventures, like adopting a dog, or taking the family on a meatless burger research trip. Last year I wrote a guide to pretending to understand Brexit. </p>
<p>
     My job also gives me access to top CEOs, whose views I share with readers. </p>
<p>
     For now I want to cover the only things on investors&apos; minds: the virus, the seized economy, and our roiled financial markets. Send your questions to jack.hough@barrons.com, along with your name and state. If you&apos;d like, speak your questions into the voice recorder on your phone and send me the file to play on the podcast. </p>
<p>
     My columns are for Barron&apos;s subscribers, but the Barron&apos;s Streetwise podcast is available for free at Apple, Spotify, and other platforms. I&apos;m particularly looking forward to being able to connect with readers at our corporate sibling, MarketWatch. Kindly subscribe to the podcast, leave a review if you like, and tell your friends. Thanks for listening. </p>
<p>
     Write to Jack Hough at jack.hough@barrons.com </p>

Stock Futures Slide as U.S. Officials Warn of Broad Covid-19 Spread -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Lisa Beilfuss </pre>
<p>
     Stock futures slid 1.6% shortly after they opened Sunday night, suggesting wild trading would continue when markets open Monday. </p>
<p>
     Major U.S. stock market indices closed lower Friday, snapping a three-day rally earlier in the week that included the Dow Jones Industrial Average&apos;s best day since 1933. That, of course, came on the heels of a series of worst-ever days for U.S. stocks earlier in March. </p>
<p>
     Growth in coronavirus cases across the U.S. remains front and center for market participants this week. Shortly before futures opened Sunday, president Donald Trump held a press conference discussing the virus, and the testing of alternative treatments. He said he is working to get approval for the sterilization of masks. Earlier Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation&apos;s top infectious disease expert, said Covid-19 would infect millions of Americans with deaths from the disease reaching 100,000 to 200,000. As of Sunday, the U.S. has reported more than 124,000 cases and more than 2,100 deaths. </p>
<p>
     Fauci suggested it is too soon to begin reopening the U.S. economy, despite comments from President Trump about possibly lifting restrictions as soon as April 12. Last week, the Labor Department said a record 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance, a number economists expect will only rise as restrictions on business and personal activity continue to prompt layoffs. Knock-on effects are already apparent as layoffs grow beyond hospitality and retail workers and consumers grow increasingly anxious. </p>
<p>
     Outside of the weekly initial jobless claims data, economic readings continue to offer little to no insight into the current state of the economy as most reports are still reflecting a pre-virus economy. On Friday, investors will get the latest monthly jobs numbers from the Labor Department, but the survey took place the week of March 12, before a surge in layoffs began. Still, it will likely be the first time since 2010 that employers let go of more workers than they hired. </p>
<p>
     Elsewhere, China&apos;s manufacturing index for March is due out Monday and is expected to show a recovery in factory activity as the Chinese government reopens the economy. Many economists are looking at Chinese data for clues about the pace of a domestic recovery once the U.S. reopens, though the comparison is far from perfect given much stricter shutdowns in China. </p>

U.S. Stock-index Futures Pare Decline After Opening Sharply Lower -- MarketWatch</headline>
<text>
<p>
  U.S. stock-index futures remained lower after kicking off trade with sharp losses Sunday night as the number of COVID-19 cases continued to rise over the weekend and investors braced for data in the coming week that&apos;s expected to underline the economic toll of the pandemic. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average  were off 245 points, or 1.1%, while S&amp;P 500 futures  were down 1.1% and Nasdaq-100 futures  shed 1%. The U.S. now has the largest number of cases worldwide at 124,763, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering&apos;s Centers for Systems Science and Engineering. The U.S. death toll stands at 2,191. President Donald Trump, speaking Sunday evening at press briefing, said the death rate was likely to hit in two weeks and that the U.S. would be &quot;well on its way to recovery&quot; by early June. </p>

Trump Administration Extends Social-Distancing Guidelines Until End of April -- 4th Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Thomas M. Burton, Talal Ansari and Giovanni Legorano </pre>
<p>
     President Trump on Sunday said he was extending the administration&apos;s social-distancing guidelines for another 30 days through the end of April, after saying for days that he was hoping to open up the country in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump, speaking at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, said the peak of the death rate was expected to hit in two weeks. &quot;Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s very important that everybody strongly follow the guidelines.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The administration last month announced a 15-day program that instructed all Americans to avoid nonessential travel, sit-down restaurants and gatherings of more than 10 people, among other steps. Meanwhile, governors and mayors nationwide have rolled out their own restrictions, shutting schools and many retail businesses. Monday will mark the 15th day of the program. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump predicted the country would be on its way to recovery by June 1. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaking alongside the president, said he and Deborah Birx, a White House response coordinator, had recommended extending the social-distancing guidelines and that the president had accepted that recommendation. He called the move a &quot;wise and prudent decision.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The press conference came as state governors pleaded for more equipment to fight the new coronavirus pandemic, as a flood of patients besieged hospitals and Mr. Fauci warned the American death toll could reach as high as 200,000. </p>
<p>
     Both Democratic and Republican party governors highlighted severe shortages of equipment that medical professionals on the front lines need to do their jobs, including masks, face shields and gowns. One particular point of concern is the scarcity of ventilators used to help restore breathing capability among severely stricken patients. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve put in orders with the national stockpile,&quot; said Louisiana&apos;s Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, speaking on CBS&apos;s Face the Nation. &quot;But we&apos;ve also pursued manufacturers and vendors trying to place orders for about 12,000 ventilators.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think thus far we&apos;ve received 192,&quot; Mr. Edwards said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump has defended his administration&apos;s work, saying that few could have anticipated the scope of the current pandemic and the economic fallout. And some governors have also praised aspects of the federal response, with Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo noting the arrival of a Navy hospital ship to help with the response. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The reality is that the people who need things will get what they need, &quot; Mr. Fauci said earlier, speaking on CNN&apos;s State of the Union program. </p>
<p>
     The governors raced to get more help as the U.S. death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus surged past 2,000 over the weekend, reaching 2,381 by Sunday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 700 of the deaths were in New York City, the American epicenter of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     Globally the death toll quintupled over the past two weeks to 30,852 on Sunday, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins. Deaths reached nearly 10,800 in Italy. </p>
<p>
     The number of confirmed American cases surpassed 132,000, the most in the world. Globally, infections world-wide climbed above 665,000. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Fauci said Sunday that projections he has examined showed the disease would kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans and infect far more &quot;looking at what we&apos;re seeing now.&quot; </p>
<p>
     He called worst-case scenario projections of more than a million U.S. deaths &quot;very, very unlikely&quot; and said any estimate could easily turn out to be wrong. He said he was certain that the number of confirmed infections would continue to rise much higher. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re going to have millions of cases,&quot; Dr. Fauci said. </p>
<p>
     He said infection rates would begin increasing outside of New York soon. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have a very difficult problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re going to see places like Detroit and other cities starting to get into trouble.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Dr. Fauci described &quot;intensive discussions&quot; through Saturday night over an idea President Trump floated to enforce a quarantine on New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. Ultimately, Dr. Fauci said Mr. Trump agreed to instead have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issue a &quot;strong advisory&quot; against travel to and from those states. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The reason for that is that you don&apos;t want to get to the point where you&apos;re...enforcing things that would create a bigger difficulty, morale and otherwise, when you could probably accomplish the same goal,&quot; Dr. Fauci said. </p>
<p>
     Other states have moved to limit the number of New Yorkers fleeing their homes there for vacation homes elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis instructed all people entering the state from the New York tri-state area to self-quarantine for 14 days. A violation could mean up to a 60 day jail sentence and fines of up to $500. </p>
<p>
     In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Riamondo issued an executive order on Saturday mandating that travelers from any state that come to Rhode Island self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. An initial executive order that specifically targeted New Yorkers was rescinded. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo has slammed measures trying to limit New Yorkers&apos; movements, calling them potentially illegal and unneighborly. </p>
<p>
     He said 965 people have died from Covid-19 in New York state, up from 728 on Saturday. The number of positive cases in the state has risen to nearly 60,000, which is still close to half of the nation&apos;s total number of confirmed cases. At least at least 8,500 people are hospitalized from complications from coronavirus in the state. </p>
<p>
     The New York governor this weekend joined other states in calling for more supplies and asking for federal coordination. He said states were trying to buy the same supplies from the same companies, bidding up the prices in the process. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Unfortunately we&apos;re competing against every other state in the United States for these same things,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said Sunday. </p>
<p>
     Many countries continued to struggle with mask supplies. In the Netherlands, health authorities recalled 600,000 masks which they had recently received from China and distributed to hospitals because they were deemed unsafe, according to Dutch broadcaster NOS. The French government said Saturday that it was organizing airlift operations to collect masks it has ordered from China amid acute shortage in France. </p>
<p>
     In Italy, the government vowed to transfer EUR400 million ($446 million) to local administrations that will be used to distribute vouchers or food to needy people in a bid to head off potential riots. Italian officials warned that lockdown measures will likely be extended, as data aren&apos;t suggesting the spread of the contagion has reached its peak. </p>
<p>
     In Russia, Moscow authorities ordered an indefinite citywide quarantine, compelling all residents to remain in their homes. The stricter measures came as the city reported 1,014 infection cases out of a nationwide total of 1,534. Eight deaths have been attributed to the illness in Russia. </p>
<p>
     In China, officials have gradually eased the draconian restrictions in central Hubei province that have cut off the flow of goods and people for about two months. </p>
<p>
     The country&apos;s civil aviation regulator reopened domestic flights Sunday in Hubei after weeks of suspension. Flights remain suspended at the province&apos;s largest airport in Wuhan, the city where the world&apos;s first cases were reported late last year. </p>
<p>
     Nearly all of China&apos;s large supermarkets, convenience stores and shopping malls have reopened, Wang Bin, an official with China&apos;s Ministry of Commerce, said Saturday, adding that more than 80% of restaurants and 60% of hotels have resumed business. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 45 new infections Saturday. Only one, in Henan province, was locally transmitted; the rest were imported from overseas, the commission said. </p>
<p>
     Some major Chinese cities including Shanghai continued to tighten control over international arrivals to get a handle on cases imported from abroad, which could trigger a second wave of infection domestically. </p>
<p>
     In India, the government worked to stop desperate migrant workers from leaving cities, warning they could be sent to quarantine camps and assuring that food and other staples would be provided for those who have lost jobs. The government shut down nonessential businesses and ordered people to stay home, mirroring efforts elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     Across Africa, coronavirus curfews and lockdowns have taken a violent turn as countries seek to contain the spreading virus. Confirmed cases in Africa have reached 4,282, from just around 800 a week ago. In Kenya, police fired tear gas at a crowd who were trying to board a ferry in the port city of Mombasa on Saturday, causing a stampede in which dozens of people were injured. </p>

Introducing Barron&apos;s Streetwise, a Podcast About Wall Street Like You&apos;ve Never Heard Before -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jack Hough </pre>
<p>
     Thank you to everyone who has subscribed to my new podcast, Barron&apos;s Streetwise , named for the column I write in Barron&apos;s. The first episode focuses on the search for a treatment for Covid-19. It also touches on what to do about the recent stock market downturn. </p>
<p>
     My Streetwise columns typically discuss things like stocks, interest rates, and Wall Street absurdities. Sometimes I include personal adventures, like adopting a dog, or taking the family on a meatless burger research trip. Last year I wrote a guide to pretending to understand Brexit. </p>
<p>
     My job also gives me access to top CEOs, whose views I share with readers. </p>
<p>
     For now I want to cover the only things on investors&apos; minds: the virus, the seized economy, and our roiled financial markets. Send your questions to jack.hough@barrons.com, along with your name and state. If you&apos;d like, speak your questions into the voice recorder on your phone and send me the file to play on the podcast. </p>
<p>
     My columns are for Barron&apos;s subscribers, but the Barron&apos;s Streetwise podcast is available for free at Apple, Spotify, and other platforms. I&apos;m particularly looking forward to being able to connect with readers at our corporate sibling, MarketWatch. Kindly subscribe to the podcast, leave a review if you like, and tell your friends. Thanks for listening. </p>

Trump Administration Extends Social-Distancing Guidelines Until End of April -- 5th Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus, Andrew Restuccia and Jennifer Calfas </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Sunday said he was extending the administration&apos;s social-distancing guidelines for another 30 days through the end of April, after saying for days that he was hoping to open up the country in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump, speaking at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, said the peak of the death rate was expected to hit in two weeks. Mr. Trump predicted the country would be on its way to recovery by June 1. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s very important that everybody strongly follow the guidelines.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The administration last month announced a 15-day program that instructed all Americans to avoid nonessential travel, sit-down restaurants and gatherings of more than 10 people, among other steps. Meanwhile, governors and mayors nationwide have rolled out their own restrictions, shutting schools and many retail businesses. </p>
<p>
     Monday will mark the 15th day of the program. The president said his earlier comments that he hoped to reopen the U.S. by Easter on April 12 were &quot;just an aspiration.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump extended the guidelines as coronavirus patients besieged hospitals in New York and other cities and the U.S. death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus surged past 2,400 over the weekend, according to Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 700 of the deaths were in New York City, the American epicenter of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     Globally the death toll quintupled over the past two weeks to 30,852 on Sunday, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins. Deaths reached nearly 10,800 in Italy, which has suffered the most fatalities. </p>
<p>
     Public-health experts have said extended social distancing is needed until the U.S. develops a vigorous testing regime to identify and isolate cases. Widespread testing is still a long way off and labs now are struggling with supply issues that are further hampering the ability to identify cases. The coronavirus can be spread when people are asymptomatic. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN Sunday that projections he has examined showed the disease would kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans and infect possibly millions. </p>
<p>
     &quot;What we&apos;re trying to do is not let that happen,&quot; Dr. Fauci said at a White House press conference Sunday. </p>
<p>
     Both Democratic and Republican party governors highlighted severe shortages of equipment that medical professionals on the front lines need to do their jobs, including masks, face shields and gowns. One particular point of concern is the scarcity of ventilators used to help restore breathing capability among severely stricken patients. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve put in orders with the national stockpile,&quot; said Louisiana&apos;s Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, speaking on CBS&apos;s Face the Nation. &quot;But we&apos;ve also pursued manufacturers and vendors trying to place orders for about 12,000 ventilators.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think thus far we&apos;ve received 192,&quot; Mr. Edwards said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said the Federal Emergency Management Agency brought 80 tons of personal protective equipment to New York on Sunday, including 130,000 N95 respirators, 1.8 million face masks and gowns and 10.3 million gloves. FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights, and Mr. Trump said he hopes to have 51 flights in total. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Many of the states are stocked up,&quot; Mr. Trump said. &quot;Some of them don&apos;t admit it.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said he was instructing his administration to take steps to provide incentives to keep restaurants open, including instructing the Treasury Department and the Labor Department to examine reinstating corporate tax deductions for the cost of business meals and entertainment. </p>
<p>
     The president called on journalists and state officials to investigate the high volume of protective masks being ordered by hospitals, suggesting hospital workers were mismanaging the supply of masks. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Where are the masks going?&quot; Mr. Trump asked, adding later, &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s hoarding. I think it&apos;s maybe worse than hoarding.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The number of confirmed American cases surpassed 139,000, the most in the world, ,according to data from Johns Hopkins. Globally, infections world-wide climbed above 718,000. Dr. Fauci said that there would be millions of cases this year in the U.S. and that infection rates would begin increasing outside of New York soon. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have a very difficult problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re going to see places like Detroit and other cities starting to get into trouble.&quot; </p>
<p>
     New York remained an epicenter in the U.S. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said 965 people have died from Covid-19 in New York state, up from 728 on Saturday. The number of positive cases in the state has risen to nearly 60,000 -- close to half of the nation&apos;s total number of confirmed cases. At least at least 8,500 people are hospitalized from complications from coronavirus in the state. </p>
<p>
     The New York governor this weekend joined other states in calling for more supplies and asking for federal coordination. He said states were trying to buy the same supplies from the same companies, bidding up the prices in the process. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Unfortunately we&apos;re competing against every other state in the United States for these same things,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said Sunday. </p>
<p>
     Other states have moved to limit the number of New Yorkers fleeing their homes there for vacation homes elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis instructed all people entering the state from the New York tri-state area to self-quarantine for 14 days. A violation could mean up to a 60 day jail sentence and fines of up to $500. </p>
<p>
     Other countries also moved to put lockdown measures in place. Italian officials warned that its strict measures will likely be extended, as data aren&apos;t suggesting the spread of the contagion has reached its peak. In Russia, Moscow authorities ordered an indefinite citywide quarantine, compelling all residents to remain in their homes. </p>
<p>
     By contrast, China, where the virus is believed to have originated, gradually eased the draconian restrictions in central Hubei province that have cut off the flow of goods and people for about two months. </p>
<p>
     Many countries continued to struggle with mask supplies. The French government said Saturday that it was organizing airlift operations to collect masks it has ordered from China amid acute shortage in France. </p>
<p>
     In India, the government worked to stop desperate migrant workers from leaving cities, warning they could be sent to quarantine camps and assuring that food and other staples would be provided for those who have lost jobs. The government shut down nonessential businesses and ordered people to stay home, mirroring efforts elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     Across Africa, coronavirus curfews and lockdowns have taken a violent turn as countries seek to contain the spreading virus. Confirmed cases in Africa have reached 4,282, from just around 800 a week ago. In Kenya, police fired tear gas at a crowd who were trying to board a ferry in the port city of Mombasa on Saturday, causing a stampede in which dozens of people were injured. </p>

Critics Say New York Budget Being Crafted With &apos;Unprecedented Secrecy&apos;</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jimmy Vielkind </pre>
<p>
     Advocacy groups of all stripes are concerned they have been shut out of the state budget negotiations set to conclude this week, a deal one longtime watchdog said is taking shape in &quot;unprecedented secrecy.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The state Capitol in March normally teems with lobbyists, citizens and officials from around the state pushing to be heard as the budget comes together. State legislators&apos; days are scheduled to the minute, and people seeking their attention can be lucky to get in a few moments during a chance encounter near the floor of the chamber. </p>
<p>
     All that ceased when the building closed to visitors on March 15 as the coronavirus spread. Legislators voted on a handful of bills on March 18, but remain scattered around the state. The traditional avenues of influence adapted by necessity. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, Citizen Action of New York, a progressive advocacy group, held a &quot;car rally&quot; where people honked on the street outside the Capitol to protest any changes to the state&apos;s new bail law, which eliminated cash bail for most misdemeanor and nonviolent felony offenses. </p>
<p>
     For most of January and February, the group held weekly rallies inside the building, arguing that the law -- which took effect Jan. 1 -- has reduced economic and racial disparities in the criminal justice system. </p>
<p>
     Law-enforcement officials as well as elected leaders in both parties, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, believe the bail law should be amended to let judges consider public safety when deciding whether to detain someone before their trial. </p>
<p>
     &quot;To roll back the bail law now or down the line is to set up for devastation in the face of this pandemic,&quot; because it is difficult to contain the virus in jails, said Erin George, the civil rights campaign director for Citizen Action. </p>
<p>
     The Alliance for Quality Education, which advocates for greater school funding, held a virtual news conference on Friday to urge legislators to raise taxes on the wealthy rather than cut services. </p>
<p>
     Brian Sampson, president of the Associated Builders and Contractors, Empire State Chapter, said the contractors he represents had to fall back on letter-writing and social-media campaigns to lobby lawmakers. Contractors are battling against building-trade unions over a provision that would broaden the definition of public works that require a higher, prevailing wage rate. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s obviously been very difficult. You&apos;re relying on phone calls, text messages and emails, and you&apos;re hoping your message is being heard,&quot; Mr. Sampson said. </p>
<p>
     Leaders of the state Senate and Assembly, both of which are controlled by Democrats, didn&apos;t release their own draft budgets to counter the $178 billion spending plan Gov. Andrew Cuomo unveiled in January. </p>
<p>
     Instead, the Democratic governor has been talking directly with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins. This practice of three people in a room is common in Albany, but without rank-and-file lawmakers close by, regular briefings have been relegated to conference calls. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Albany in the best of times is secretive,&quot; said Blair Horner, a longtime leader of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a watchdog organization. &quot;We&apos;re now entering a black hole of information where even light can&apos;t escape. It&apos;s as dark as dark can be. Unless you&apos;re hiring the hot-wired lobbyists, it&apos;s hard to find out what&apos;s going on.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo has appeared regularly in the Capitol to offer updates on the state&apos;s response to the coronavirus outbreak, and he has fielded some budget questions. The coronavirus has had big impacts on the state economy and decreased revenue projections by around 15%. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is the easiest budget we&apos;ve done,&quot; Mr. Cuomo joked to a legislator recently and recounted during a public radio interview. &quot;We have no money.&quot; </p>
<p>
     THE QUESTION: New York&apos;s budget must be in place by April 1, but lawmakers often miss the deadline. How many days late was the tardiest budget, and who was governor when it was finally adopted? </p>
<p>
     -- Know the answer? Leave a comment! </p>
<p>
     THE LAST ANSWER: Governors John Dix, William Marcy, William Seward, Horatio Seymour and Silas Wright each have mountains named after them in the Adirondack Park. </p>

Update: U.S. Stock-index Futures Pare Decline After Opening Sharply Lower -- MarketWatch</headline>
<text>
<p>
  U.S. stock-index futures remained lower after kicking off trade with sharp losses Sunday night as the number of COVID-19 cases continued to rise over the weekend and investors braced for data in the coming week that&apos;s expected to underline the economic toll of the pandemic. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average  were off 245 points, or 1.1%, while S&amp;P 500 futures  were down 1.1% and Nasdaq-100 futures  shed 1%. The U.S. now has the largest number of cases worldwide at 124,763, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering&apos;s Centers for Systems Science and Engineering. The U.S. death toll stands at 2,191. President Donald Trump, speaking Sunday evening at press briefing, said the death rate was likely to hit in two weeks and that the U.S. would be &quot;well on its way to recovery&quot; by early June. </p>

Senior Wall Street Executive Dies of Coronavirus -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Liz Hoffman </pre>
<p>
     The 56-year-old chief financial officer of investment bank Jefferies has died from the coronavirus, the firm said Sunday. He is the first senior Wall Street executive known to have succumbed to the disease, which has killed more than 30,000 people world-wide. </p>
<p>
     The New York-based firm announced Peg Broadbent&apos;s death Sunday morning and named Teri Gendron, currently CFO of Jefferies&apos;s financial-services arm, as his interim successor. </p>
<p>
     &quot;His decency, calmness and dry wit were always there, always making things better,&quot; Jefferies CEO Rich Handler and President Brian Friedman wrote in a joint statement. &quot;We will miss him terribly.&quot; </p>
<p>
     A U.K. native who worked in the firm&apos;s New York office, Mr. Broadbent -- Peg was short for Peregrine -- started his career at a predecessor firm to PricewaterhouseCoopers and spent 16 years at Morgan Stanley, where his wife, Hayley, was a longtime executive. He had been CFO at Jefferies since 2007, making him one of Wall Street&apos;s longest-serving finance chiefs and one of only a few still in the job who had weathered the 2008 recession. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Broadbent &quot;helped us build Jefferies from less than half its current size, and navigate through hard times and good times,&quot; Messrs. Handler and Friedman said. </p>
<p>
     Tom Thees worked with Mr. Broadbent at Morgan Stanley, where Mr. Thees was a senior trading executive. He remembered a discussion with Mr. Broadbent in 2002, when the two disagreed over valuations in the firm&apos;s corporate-bond book. </p>
<p>
     &quot;He was the ultimate professional,&quot; said Mr. Thees, who before picking up a call from a reporter had fired off a note of condolence to Messrs. Handler and Friedman. &quot;He did his job and did it well.&quot; </p>
<p>
     As the coronavirus has spread across the world, much of its destruction has been borne by older people or by workers who interact with the general public -- health-care providers, store owners and others whose jobs mean they can&apos;t easily isolate themselves. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Broadbent was neither. He was the CFO of a large white-collar company that, like most, has been largely working remotely for the past few weeks. </p>
<p>
     It couldn&apos;t immediately be determined when Mr. Broadbent fell ill or whether he had underlying health conditions that might have contributed to his death. Coronavirus is especially dangerous for people with compromised immune systems and pre-existing lung or other health problems. </p>
<p>
     When Jefferies reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday, Mr. Broadbent&apos;s name, typically listed at the bottom of the release, was missing. </p>
<p>
     Paul Wirth, Morgan Stanley&apos;s deputy CFO, called Mr. Broadbent &quot;a typical Englishman,&quot; reserved but genuine and hard-working. He had a loyal enough following at the Wall Street firm that many of his subordinates later followed him to Jefferies. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There are a lot of people out there who are going to be very lost because of this,&quot; Mr. Wirth said. </p>

Kelly, EVO&apos;s Chief Executive Officer. &quot;The long-term fundamentals of EVO&apos;s business remain strong and, as the economy recovers, we believe these actions will support EVO&apos;s continued growth through the execution of our strategic plan.&quot; </p>
<p>
  A portion of the proceeds from MDP&apos;s investment will be used to pay down EVO&apos;s revolver borrowings, reducing EVO&apos;s pro forma leverage ratio as of December 31, 2019 to 3.3x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA.  The remainder of the proceeds are expected to be used to fund potential future investment opportunities. </p>
<p>
  EVO is closely monitoring COVID-19 and its impact on the Company&apos;s business. While EVO&apos;s global portfolio represents a diversified mix of merchants across Europe and North America, many of these merchants operate in markets that are subject to broad governmental restrictions on movement and commerce, resulting in substantial reductions in merchant transaction count and volumes. </p>
<p>
  In response, EVO has taken significant and necessary steps to align its cost structure and cash flows with the expected near-term decline in revenues caused by COVID-19.  These actions include a series of initiatives to reduce fixed costs up to 20% for the remainder of fiscal 2020 and lower capital expenditures by up to 75% over the same period. Such reductions will depend on the pace in which economic activity returns. </p>
<p>
  Given the unknown duration and extent of COVID-19&apos;s impact on EVO&apos;s business, the Company is suspending its 2020 annual guidance published on February 27, 2020. </p>
<p>
  Ray Sidhom, Chairman of EVO&apos;s Board of Directors, stated, &quot;We value our long-term relationship with MDP, and we welcome their strong and demonstrated commitment to the future of EVO as it navigates this global pandemic.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Vahe Dombalagian, a Managing Director on MDP&apos;s Financial &amp; Transaction Services team and a member of EVO&apos;s Board of Directors, added, &quot;We have been impressed with EVO&apos;s growth strategy since we made our initial investment in December 2012. We look forward to building on our partnership with EVO&apos;s leadership team as we work together to continue to extend the Company&apos;s global footprint and further its growth.&quot; </p>

Forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs, assumptions, estimates, and expectations, taking into account the information currently available to us, and are not guarantees of future results or performance. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions (including uncertainties around the duration and severity of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak that are difficult to predict) that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations of future results we express or imply in any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Factors that could contribute to these differences include the following:  (1) the successful closing of the investment by MDP and achievement of its potential benefits; (2) the effects of global economic, political, market, health and other conditions, including the impact of the coronavirus; (3) geopolitical and other risks associated with our operations outside of the United States; (4) any decline in the use of cards as a payment mechanism or other adverse developments with respect to the card industry in general; (5) declines in consumer spending; (6) changes in foreign currency exchange rates; (7) risks relating to our indebtedness; (8) the impact of social distancing, shelter-in-place, shutdowns of non-essential businesses and similar measures imposed or undertaken by governments, companies and consumers in an effort to combat the spread of the coronavirus; and (9) the other risks and uncertainties included from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including those listed under &quot;Risk Factors&quot; contained in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

<p>
  The non-GAAP financial measures presented herein should not be considered in isolation of, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such measures may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Management uses these adjusted financial performance measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.  Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures, together with other metrics, to set goals for and measure the performance of the business and to determine incentive compensation.  The Company believes that these adjusted measures provide useful information to investors about the Company&apos;s ongoing underlying operating performance and enhance the overall understanding of financial performance of the Company&apos;s core business by presenting the Company&apos;s results without giving effect to one or more of the following: equity-based compensation, giving pro forma effect to a normalized effective tax rate for the Company, costs related to transition, acquisition and integration matters. </p>

Press Release: EVO Provides COVID-19 Update and -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Specifically, adjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance. This measure, or similar measures, are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income before provision for income taxes, net interest expense, and depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact of net income from consolidated subsidiaries (including related depreciation and amortization), share-based compensation, and transition, acquisition and integration costs. The calculation of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, including: (a) it does not reflect the Company&apos;s cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (b) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company&apos;s working capital needs; (c) it does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company&apos;s indebtedness; (d) it does not reflect the Company&apos;s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay the Company&apos;s taxes; and (e) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. </p>

U.S. Extends Social-Distancing Guidelines Until End of April -- 6th Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus, Andrew Restuccia and Jennifer Calfas </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Sunday said he was extending the administration&apos;s social-distancing guidelines for another 30 days through the end of April, after saying for days that he was hoping to open up the country in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump, speaking at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, said the peak of the death rate from the new coronavirus was expected to hit in two weeks. Mr. Trump predicted the country would be on its way to recovery by June 1. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s very important that everybody strongly follow the guidelines.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The administration last month announced a 15-day program that instructed all Americans to avoid nonessential travel, sit-down restaurants and gatherings of more than 10 people, among other steps. Governors and mayors nationwide have rolled out their own restrictions, shutting schools and many retail businesses. </p>
<p>
     Monday will mark the 15th day of the program. The president said his earlier comments that he hoped to reopen the U.S. by Easter on April 12 were &quot;just an aspiration.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump extended the guidelines as coronavirus patients besieged hospitals in New York and other cities and the U.S. death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus surged past 2,400 over the weekend, according to Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 700 of the deaths were in New York City, the American center of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     Globally the death toll quintupled over the past two weeks to 33,881 on Sunday, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins. Deaths reached nearly 10,800 in Italy, which has suffered the most fatalities. </p>
<p>
     Public-health experts have said extended social distancing is needed until the U.S. develops a vigorous testing regime to identify and isolate cases. Widespread testing is still a long way off and labs now are struggling with supply issues that are further hampering the ability to identify cases. The coronavirus can be spread when people are asymptomatic. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said he didn&apos;t anticipate relaxing the guidelines before April 30 even for regions less affected by the virus. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN Sunday that projections he has examined showed the disease would kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans and infect possibly millions. </p>
<p>
     &quot;What we&apos;re trying to do is not let that happen,&quot; Dr. Fauci said at a White House press conference Sunday. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said there were once projections of over 2 million deaths. &quot;So, if we can hold that down, as we&apos;re saying to 100,000 -- it&apos;s a horrible number -- maybe even less, but to 100,000 -- so we have between 100,000 to 200,000 -- we all together have done a very good job,&quot; the president said. </p>
<p>
     Both Democratic and Republican party governors highlighted severe shortages of equipment that medical professionals on the front lines need to do their jobs, including masks, face shields and gowns. One particular point of concern is the scarcity of ventilators used to help restore breathing capability among severely stricken patients. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve put in orders with the national stockpile,&quot; said Louisiana&apos;s Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, speaking on CBS&apos;s Face the Nation. &quot;But we&apos;ve also pursued manufacturers and vendors trying to place orders for about 12,000 ventilators.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think thus far we&apos;ve received 192,&quot; Mr. Edwards said. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo this weekend joined other states in calling for more supplies and asking for federal coordination. He said states were trying to buy the same supplies from the same companies, bidding up the prices in the process. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Unfortunately we&apos;re competing against every other state in the United States for these same things,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said Sunday. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said the Federal Emergency Management Agency brought 80 tons of personal protective equipment to New York on Sunday, including 130,000 N95 respirators, 1.8 million face masks and gowns and 10.3 million gloves. FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights, and Mr. Trump said he hopes to have 51 flights in total. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Many of the states are stocked up,&quot; Mr. Trump said. &quot;Some of them don&apos;t admit it.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said he was instructing his administration to take steps to provide incentives to keep restaurants open, including instructing the Treasury Department and the Labor Department to examine reinstating corporate tax deductions for the cost of business meals and entertainment. </p>
<p>
     The president called on journalists and state officials to investigate the high volume of protective masks being ordered by hospitals, suggesting hospital workers were mismanaging the supply of masks. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Where are the masks going?&quot; Mr. Trump asked, adding later, &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s hoarding. I think it&apos;s maybe worse than hoarding.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump praised General Motors, saying the company was doing a &quot;fantastic job&quot; producing ventilators. His comments came two days after he invoked the Defense Production Act to order the company to make ventilators, accusing GM of &quot;wasting time&quot; in negotiations. &quot;I don&apos;t think we have to worry about General Motors now,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     The number of confirmed American cases surpassed 139,000, the most in the world, according to the Johns Hopkins data. Globally, infections world-wide climbed above 718,000. Dr. Fauci said that there would be millions of cases this year in the U.S. and that infection rates would begin increasing outside of New York soon. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have a very difficult problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re going to see places like Detroit and other cities starting to get into trouble.&quot; </p>
<p>
     New York remained an epicenter in the U.S. Mr. Cuomo said 965 people have died from Covid-19 in New York state, up from 728 on Saturday. The number of positive cases in the state has risen to nearly 60,000 -- close to half of the nation&apos;s total number of confirmed cases. At least at least 8,500 people are hospitalized from complications from coronavirus in the state. </p>
<p>
     Other states have moved to limit the number of New Yorkers fleeing their homes there for vacation homes elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis instructed all people entering the state from the New York tri-state area to self-quarantine for 14 days. A violation could mean up to a 60 day jail sentence and fines of up to $500. </p>
<p>
     Other countries also moved to put lockdown measures in place. Italian officials warned that its strict measures will likely be extended, as data aren&apos;t suggesting the spread of the contagion has reached its peak. In Russia, Moscow authorities ordered an indefinite citywide quarantine, compelling all residents to remain in their homes. </p>
<p>
     By contrast, China, where the virus is believed to have originated, gradually eased the draconian restrictions in central Hubei province that have cut off the flow of goods and people for about two months. </p>
<p>
     Many countries continued to struggle with mask supplies. The French government said Saturday that it was organizing airlift operations to collect masks it has ordered from China amid acute shortage in France. </p>
<p>
     In India, the government worked to stop desperate migrant workers from leaving cities, warning they could be sent to quarantine camps and assuring that food and other staples would be provided for those who have lost jobs. The government shut down nonessential businesses and ordered people to stay home, mirroring efforts elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     Across Africa, coronavirus curfews and lockdowns have taken a violent turn as countries seek to contain the spreading virus. Confirmed cases in Africa have reached 4,282, from just around 800 a week ago. In Kenya, police fired tear gas at a crowd who were trying to board a ferry in the port city of Mombasa on Saturday, causing a stampede in which dozens of people were injured. </p>

<text>
<pre>
 
   By Jaewon Kang 
 </pre>
<p>
  Instacart Inc. has partnered with a third party to provide hand sanitizers and other safety products for its shoppers, it said Sunday. </p>
<p>
  The grocery-delivery company is also introducing a feature that will allow users to set a default tip amount. </p>
<p>
  The San Francisco-based group said the new default will help shoppers earn a higher amount of tips. </p>
<p>
  Over the past month, Instacart shoppers have earned over 40% more than they did in the same period a year ago, the company said. </p>

HQ Trivia to Return Sunday Night Thanks to Anonymous Investor</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Sarah E. Needleman </pre>
<p>
     The mobile quiz app HQ Trivia is coming back Sunday night thanks to an anonymous investor who provided the funding it needed to resume operations, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>
     A push notification alerted people with the app on their devices that it would return at its usual time of 9 p.m. ET. Financial details of the potential deal couldn&apos;t be determined. </p>
<p>
     HQ Trivia, which launched in 2017, abruptly shut down in February and laid off roughly 25 workers after struggling for months with rising costs and declining viewership. Rus Yusupov, co-founder of HQ Trivia, said a few days later on Twitter the show could soon return in a &quot;new home,&quot; but that didn&apos;t happen until now. </p>
<p>
     Last week, the game&apos;s Twitter feed posted an ellipsis, possibly a hint to fans that a comeback was pending, in its first tweet since Feb. 22. </p>
<p>
     HQ Trivia grew quickly in popularity by persuading mobile users to log in at specific times twice a day for a chance to win cash prizes. At one point, HQ Trivia was drawing millions of players daily, with each episode offering 15 minutes of multiple-choice questions covering a range of topics. </p>
<p>
     Technical glitches and challenges in raising funds to cover the game&apos;s large prize pools eroded its popularity over time, as well as the 2018 death of HQ Trivia co-founder Colin Kroll. </p>
<p>
     Since the game show ended, fans have expressed dismay over its demise on social media. </p>
<p>
     More recently, people have remarked how its revival would be ideal now given that so many people are staying home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. On March 11, one person tweeted: &quot;Quarantine seems like a really good time to play a live mobile game show where you answer trivia questions on your phone to win cash. Somebody should make that.&quot; </p>

Press Release: Moderna Provides Update on the Impact of COVID-19 on Business Operations and Clinical Program Development</headline>
<text>
<p>
Moderna Provides Update on the Impact of COVID-19 on Business Operations and Clinical Program Development </p>
<p>
  Conference call to be held on Monday, March 30 at 8:00 a.m. ET </p>
<pre>
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2020-- </pre>
<p>
  Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients, today provided an update on the impact of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic on its business operations and clinical program development. </p>
<p>
  Moderna&apos;s paramount obligation is to ensure the safety of all participants in its clinical programs and the integrity of the studies in which they participate. Moderna is actively monitoring the situation and making adjustments where necessary, and is responding to regulatory, institutional, and government guidance and policies related to COVID-19. The Company is using a risk-based framework to evaluate new participant enrollment and new site initiation on a case-by-case basis. Moderna remains committed to its clinical development plans and is working closely with all stakeholders to try to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the Company&apos;s ongoing clinical trials. </p>
<p>
  The safety and well-being of Moderna employees is also a top priority for the Company. On March 2, the Company created an internal, cross-functional COVID-19 Response Team to closely monitor the evolving situation and advise on the Company&apos;s response. In alignment with public health strategies designed to slow the spread of COVID-19, as of March 12 the Company transitioned to a remote work plan for many employees. Essential in-person laboratory, manufacturing and related functions continue on site, and the Company has restricted visitors and implemented heightened policies to ensure the safety of employees and business continuation. Other employees continue to perform business activities from remote locations. </p>
<p>
  &quot;The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges and we are committed to ensuring the health and safety of all participants in our and our partners&apos; clinical trials, our clinical trial site teams, vendors and our employees. Moderna&apos;s primary focus is on the safety of all involved and the continued conduct of our clinical programs as we navigate the pandemic together,&quot; said St&#233;phane Bancel, Moderna&apos;s Chief Executive Officer. &quot;We are also focused on responding to the pandemic through our work on our vaccine candidate against COVID-19, mRNA-1273. We are grateful to everyone both inside and outside Moderna who is working to address this public health crisis. We will get through this together.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Summary of Clinical Trial Impact of COVID-19 </p>
<p>
  Based on the special concerns for the safety and health of pediatric patients and their caregivers, and the risks of disruption to the integrity of trials from COVID-19, the Company has decided to pause new enrollment of its Phase 1 rare disease clinical trials (mRNA-3704 for MMA, mRNA-3927 for PA) and its age de-escalation trial for its pediatric respiratory vaccine (mRNA-1653 for hMPV/PIV3). These decisions will be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis as the COVID-19 situation evolves. </p>
<p>
  The Company plans to provide a detailed update on its clinical development programs during its first quarter 2020 conference call. Additional program-specific updates as of today follow. </p>
<p>
  Infectious Diseases </p>
<p>
  The Company is closely monitoring its ongoing Phase 2 CMV (mRNA-1647) and Phase 1 Zika (mRNA-1893) clinical trials. Both trials are fully enrolled, but some participants have not yet received all scheduled doses of the vaccines. The Company is aware that some participants will not be able to receive their next vaccine dose on time or at all due to the disruptions from COVID-19 and is evaluating the impact on the integrity of these trials. </p>
<p>
  Due to the pandemic, the Company has decided to suspend new enrollment of participants in the on-going hMPV/PIV3 study (mRNA-1653), which had been actively enrolling seropositive pediatric participants (12-36 months of age). The Company intends to work with appropriate medical and site personnel to determine when to resume new enrollment. </p>
<p>
  The Company&apos;s work on mRNA-1273, its vaccine candidate against the novel coronavirus continues to progress and updates can be found on the Company&apos;s website. </p>
<p>
  Rare Diseases </p>
<p>
  Moderna has decided to pause new enrollment and new site initiation for its rare disease clinical trials with open Investigational New Drug (IND) applications, methylmalonic acidemia (MMA; mRNA-3704) and propionic acidemia (PA; mRNA-3927), to ensure the safety of these patients and their caregivers. No patients have been dosed to date. </p>
<p>
  Moderna has also been notified that the enrollment of further subjects in the Company&apos;s chikungunya virus antibody trial (mRNA-1944) has been paused by the site due to the impact of COVID-19. </p>
<p>
  Oncology </p>
<p>
  Moderna is continuing to treat current patients and enroll new patients in Company-sponsored oncology studies, including its Personalized Cancer Vaccine (mRNA-4157), Triplet (mRNA-2752) and OX40L (mRNA-2416) programs. Despite this, COVID-19 related challenges are leading to delays in enrollment. The Company is continuing to evaluate the initiation of new sites in oncology using a risk-based framework. </p>
<p>
  Financial and Operations Update </p>
<p>
  In February 2020, the Company raised $550 million in net proceeds from a common stock offering. The Company has established a wide range of strategic alliances with leading biopharmaceutical companies and has received grants from government-sponsored and private organizations focused on global health initiatives. As of February 29, 2020, Moderna had up to $183 million (unaudited) in additional funding available from grants (including amounts not yet committed)(1) . With cash and investments of approximately $1.77 billion as of February 29, 2020 (unaudited), and access to additional grant funding, Moderna has access to up to $1.95 billion in capital, which the Company expects will provide several years of cash to fund the business. Certain business disruptions related to COVID-19 are likely to lead to lower spending in 2020, while the Company is accelerating work on its vaccine candidate (mRNA-1273) against COVID-19 and is engaged in discussions for outside funding of such activities. The Company will provide an update to its 2020 financial guidance, if any, on its first quarter 2020 conference call. </p>
<p>
  Conference Call and Webcast Information </p>

Sports Industry Reels From Coronavirus Fallout</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Ben Cohen, Joshua Robinson and Joe Flint </pre>
<p>
     The story of international sports over the past decade was one of unlimited growth, unrestrained spending and unwavering popularity. Coronavirus brought the sports business to an immediate standstill. The boom times went bust overnight. </p>
<p>
     Now, for the investors who plowed their fortunes into team ownership and the leagues that have gotten used to a gusher of money, the crisis risks turning into a reckoning. </p>
<p>
     The cancellation of the March Madness college-basketball tournament already has caused the NCAA to reduce its annual distribution to member institutions by nearly two-thirds, from $600 million to $225 million. Amateur sports bodies in the U.S. tried unsuccessfully to join the congressional bailout because their losses from the delay of the Olympics could be in the range of $800 million. </p>
<p>
     Some team owners believe the biggest problem facing sports is more philosophical than financial. It is the idea that public interaction is now associated with fear. </p>
<p>
     The consequences across the business are only beginning to come into focus. Every day without sports costs the leagues and broadcasting networks huge sums of money that even savvy financial officers can&apos;t wrap their minds around. </p>
<p>
     National Basketball Association teams have closed the doors to their practice gyms, leaving the most talented players on the planet stuck in their homes with nowhere to work out, as the league office braces for an incalculable financial hit. Major League Baseball on Friday agreed to float players a $170 million advance on their salaries as they come to grips with a potentially long shutdown. The leagues are examining how to come back and play even before fans are reintroduced to the equation -- possibly ushering in an era of empty arenas as sound stages for sports broadcasts. </p>
<p>
     That might not fly with the players. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I just don&apos;t know how we can imagine a sporting event without fans,&quot; Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James said on a podcast last week. &quot;There&apos;s no excitement. There&apos;s no crying. There&apos;s no joy.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. James also balked at the concept of a neutral-site postseason with players quarantined in a bubble at the same hotel, and scoffed at the possibility of plowing ahead to the playoffs without completing the regular season. </p>
<p>
     When soccer&apos;s English Premier League shut down with Liverpool just two wins from clinching the title, team star Virgil van Dijk sounded a similar note: &quot;If we won it in an empty stadium and the fans weren&apos;t there, I&apos;d be gutted for them. No one wants to play games without the fans.&quot; </p>
<p>
     That approach hasn&apos;t worked in countries that were hit hard by the virus before the U.S. South Korea&apos;s basketball league was suspended on Feb. 29 and canceled last week, while Japan played a weekend of basketball games without spectators before deciding to cancel. The Chinese Basketball Association went dark in January and still hasn&apos;t returned. </p>
<p>
     The National Football League has been mostly spared, for now, by sheer accident of timing, but that will change if sheltering in place remains the norm or the virus is still roaring in the fall. English soccer went from beaming live games worth more than $8 billion in broadcast rights into 190 countries to zero in the space of a weekend. </p>
<p>
     The last sports domino to fall was this summer&apos;s Olympics. After weeks of wobbling, it finally tipped last week, when the International Olympic Committee begrudgingly agreed to postpone the Tokyo Games until next year. The costs of maintaining Olympic infrastructure during what could be a global recession will almost certainly tax a budget that already had swelled to $25 billion. </p>
<p>
     Media analyst Michael Nathanson forecast that if the NBA were to shut down the season and cancel the playoffs, it would cost Walt Disney Co.&apos;s ESPN and ABC $481 million and WarnerMedia&apos;s TNT $211 million in lost ad revenue -- and that comes in a season when the NBA itself was already bracing for a $400 million hit from a standoff with China over a tweet from a team executive that supported protesters in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>
     The financial effects on teams could be felt for far longer than the pandemic. Even with serious challenges to the sports-business model, including the shrinking cable-television market, the industry as a whole had grown over the last decade. Driven by skyrocketing media rights, team valuations had traveled in only one direction: up. </p>
<p>
     In no league is there a neater trend line than the NBA. The six teams sold between 2011 and May 2014 went for the average price of roughly $400 million. The four teams that have changed hands since then sold for an average of $1.85 billion. </p>
<p>
     Those astronomical valuations were driven almost completely by huge increases in the price of television rights over the past 15 years. The NFL sold its annual broadcast rights from 2007 to 2013 for an average of $1.9 billion a season. From 2014 to 2022, that number is $3.1 billion. The NBA isn&apos;t far behind, with broadcasters spending about $2.7 billion annually for the rights. </p>
<p>
     Television executives are scrambling to figure out how to protect that investment if their prized asset stays off the air. </p>
<p>
     There is widespread agreement among TV programmers that the coronavirus pandemic qualifies as an &quot;act of God&quot; and meets the requirements for a force majeure clause. But it is unlikely that TV programmers will invoke such clauses, for two reasons, according to people familiar with executives&apos; thinking. Major networks don&apos;t want to damage their relationships with leagues, which are long-running and serve as one of the few remaining linchpins for the cable bundle. And with rights deals expiring soon, including the NFL&apos;s, TV programmers are eager to preserve as much goodwill as possible going into those negotiations. </p>
<p>
     The majority of owners in the major American leagues are wealthy enough that they will be able to absorb a hit without having to dump assets. &quot;I don&apos;t think we should be having a bake sale for the owners,&quot; said the former chairman of Fox Sports, David Hill. </p>
<p>
     Experts aren&apos;t expecting a fire sale of franchises valued in the billions. But for anyone who was considering cashing out in the near term, the uncertainty created by the coronavirus could be a powerful argument against it. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I don&apos;t know if there will be any inventory going forward,&quot; said Steve Horowitz, a partner at a leading sports investment bank, Inner Circle Sports. &quot;But if an NFL or NBA team came on the market tomorrow, the list of interested people would still be long -- and none of them would look back with any regret.&quot; </p>
<p>
     That could be a different story across the Atlantic, where there is so much professional soccer that many teams were clinging to survival even before the pandemic. Lower-tier clubs already have called on the lavishly funded Premier League to organize a bailout. At least a dozen teams operating on paper-thin margins could face bankruptcy without one. In a letter to club heads around Europe on Thursday, Andrea Agnelli, chairman of Italian giant Juventus, called the situation &quot;the biggest challenge our game and industry has ever faced.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are all football executives responsible for the well-being and sustainability of the clubs we manage, which are faced with a real existential threat,&quot; he said. &quot;No one is immune, and timing is of the essence.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Women&apos;s sports also could be among the biggest losers. After a banner 12 months that saw female athletes command record television audiences and make big strides in their fight for equal pay, this is the worst possible time to go dark. The U.S. women&apos;s national soccer team planned to capitalize on its 2019 World Cup victory by seizing the spotlight at the Tokyo Olympics and building a more sustainable domestic professional league. </p>
<p>
     As baseball, basketball and hockey try to figure out what the rest of 2020 looks like, so far it is business as usual for the NFL. The heavyweight American sports league struck a new long-term labor agreement with its players earlier this month and now turns its attention toward new TV deals, even though the current pacts still have a few seasons left on them. </p>
<p>
     While talks between the networks and their current rights holders are still in the preliminary stage, the NFL doesn&apos;t believe the current health crisis will have any impact on its future contracts, one network executive said. These conversations are continuing apart from the threat poised to disrupt the 2020-21 season and the potential financial impact of lost games. These rights deals are seen as post-pandemic business by the NFL -- at least for now. </p>
<p>
     One lesson of the pandemic, however, is how quickly things change. Hours after the NBA suspended its season, ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro met with the company&apos;s executives to discuss how the virus might disrupt the network&apos;s schedule. Then, they found out the season was on hold when they read the news on their own network. The next day, ESPN&apos;s programming team scrawled various hypotheticals on a white board to fill the gaps in the schedule. Could they get the rights to air WrestleMania from World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.? What about airing a seven-hour marathon of Tom Brady game footage? Was the network&apos;s new documentary on Michael Jordan ready to release early? </p>
<p>
     NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has spoken several times with Mr. Pitaro and WarnerMedia News and Sports Chairman Jeff Zucker since then, and some network executives are optimistic that the NBA season can still be concluded this year. One scenario floated in conversations is the possibility of televising the NBA playoffs without spectators to protect players and fans from contracting the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban predicts there will be a premium on content from sports leagues like the NBA when there are games again. As people around the world exhaust their Netflix queues, and with the production of movies and television shows effectively shut down, he expects there will be enormous demand for something new to watch. NBA games could help solve that problem. </p>

Sports Industry Reels From Coronavirus Fallout -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     &quot;People will literally be doing anything to watch us,&quot; he said in an email. &quot;They won&apos;t even necessarily be basketball fans. They just will be starving for new content, and we will be there to feed them.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For now, the broadcasters&apos; pain is obvious in their threadbare TV schedules. CBS had been gearing up for its two showpiece events of the spring in the NCAA Tournament and the Masters. Now it is offering viewers the cold comfort of police procedurals. NBC Sports&apos; weekend schedule would normally be packed with live English soccer. Instead it aired reruns of dog shows. </p>
<p>
     The networks might have the opposite problem in the fall: too much inventory. The Kentucky Derby has been delayed from the first Saturday in May to September. The French Open was moved from June to October. The NBA playoffs could last until the late summer and overlap with the start of the NFL and college-football seasons. All that is based on speculative assumptions that severe control measures will be effective, transmission will slow in the summer and the virus won&apos;t wreak havoc in the fall. </p>
<p>
     There is a growing sense that the global sports hiatus could be an opportunity to do things differently when the games return. Some are asking whether the baseball season really needs to be 162 games long or if the NBA calendar should be pushed back two months so that it doesn&apos;t conflict with the NFL&apos;s. </p>
<p>
     One innovative idea came from Wayne Rooney, the former Manchester United forward, who proposed shifting the entire European soccer calendar to operate January to October instead of August to May for a couple of seasons. The idea would be to better line up with the next World Cup, which will be held starting November 2022 in Qatar. </p>
<p>
     The shutdown of sports when Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus and the NBA suspended its season on March 11 was the moment when it hit many Americans that life was about to be very different. The restart of sports might be a signal that the worst is over and the new normal is finally about to begin. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We need sports,&quot; Mr. Cuban said, &quot;as much as sports needs fans.&quot; </p>

Sports Industry Reels From Coronavirus Fallout</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Ben Cohen, Joshua Robinson and Joe Flint </pre>
<p>
     The story of international sports over the past decade was one of unlimited growth, unrestrained spending and unwavering popularity. Coronavirus brought the sports business to an immediate standstill. The boom times went bust overnight. </p>
<p>
     Now, for the investors who plowed their fortunes into team ownership and the leagues that have gotten used to a gusher of money, the crisis risks turning into a reckoning. </p>
<p>
     The cancellation of the March Madness college-basketball tournament already has caused the NCAA to reduce its annual distribution to member institutions by nearly two-thirds, from $600 million to $225 million. Amateur sports bodies in the U.S. tried unsuccessfully to join the congressional bailout because their losses from the delay of the Olympics could be in the range of $800 million. </p>
<p>
     Some team owners believe the biggest problem facing sports is more philosophical than financial. It is the idea that public interaction is now associated with fear. </p>
<p>
     The consequences across the business are only beginning to come into focus. Every day without sports costs the leagues and broadcasting networks huge sums of money that even savvy financial officers can&apos;t wrap their minds around. </p>
<p>
     National Basketball Association teams have closed the doors to their practice gyms, leaving the most talented players on the planet stuck in their homes with nowhere to work out, as the league office braces for an incalculable financial hit. Major League Baseball on Friday agreed to float players a $170 million advance on their salaries as they come to grips with a potentially long shutdown. The leagues are examining how to come back and play even before fans are reintroduced to the equation -- possibly ushering in an era of empty arenas as sound stages for sports broadcasts. </p>
<p>
     That might not fly with the players. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I just don&apos;t know how we can imagine a sporting event without fans,&quot; Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James said on a podcast last week. &quot;There&apos;s no excitement. There&apos;s no crying. There&apos;s no joy.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. James also balked at the concept of a neutral-site postseason with players quarantined in a bubble at the same hotel, and scoffed at the possibility of plowing ahead to the playoffs without completing the regular season. </p>
<p>
     When soccer&apos;s English Premier League shut down with Liverpool just two wins from clinching the title, team star Virgil van Dijk sounded a similar note: &quot;If we won it in an empty stadium and the fans weren&apos;t there, I&apos;d be gutted for them. No one wants to play games without the fans.&quot; </p>
<p>
     That approach hasn&apos;t worked in countries that were hit hard by the virus before the U.S. South Korea&apos;s basketball league was suspended on Feb. 29 and canceled last week, while Japan played a weekend of basketball games without spectators before deciding to cancel. The Chinese Basketball Association went dark in January and still hasn&apos;t returned. </p>
<p>
     The National Football League has been mostly spared, for now, by sheer accident of timing, but that will change if sheltering in place remains the norm or the virus is still roaring in the fall. English soccer went from beaming live games worth more than $8 billion in broadcast rights into 190 countries to zero in the space of a weekend. </p>
<p>
     The last sports domino to fall was this summer&apos;s Olympics. After weeks of wobbling, it finally tipped last week, when the International Olympic Committee begrudgingly agreed to postpone the Tokyo Games until next year. The costs of maintaining Olympic infrastructure during what could be a global recession will almost certainly tax a budget that already had swelled to $25 billion. </p>
<p>
     Media analyst Michael Nathanson forecast that if the NBA were to shut down the season and cancel the playoffs, it would cost Walt Disney Co.&apos;s ESPN and ABC $481 million and WarnerMedia&apos;s TNT $211 million in lost ad revenue -- and that comes in a season when the NBA itself was already bracing for a $400 million hit from a standoff with China over a tweet from a team executive that supported protesters in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>
     The financial effects on teams could be felt for far longer than the pandemic. Even with serious challenges to the sports-business model, including the shrinking cable-television market, the industry as a whole had grown over the last decade. Driven by skyrocketing media rights, team valuations had traveled in only one direction: up. </p>
<p>
     In no league is there a neater trend line than the NBA. The six teams sold between 2011 and May 2014 went for the average price of roughly $400 million. The four teams that have changed hands since then sold for an average of $1.85 billion. </p>
<p>
     Those astronomical valuations were driven almost completely by huge increases in the price of television rights over the past 15 years. The NFL sold its annual broadcast rights from 2007 to 2013 for an average of $1.9 billion a season. From 2014 to 2022, that number is $3.1 billion. The NBA isn&apos;t far behind, with broadcasters spending about $2.7 billion annually for the rights. </p>
<p>
     Television executives are scrambling to figure out how to protect that investment if their prized asset stays off the air. </p>
<p>
     There is widespread agreement among TV programmers that the coronavirus pandemic qualifies as an &quot;act of God&quot; and meets the requirements for a force majeure clause. But it is unlikely that TV programmers will invoke such clauses, for two reasons, according to people familiar with executives&apos; thinking. Major networks don&apos;t want to damage their relationships with leagues, which are long-running and serve as one of the few remaining linchpins for the cable bundle. And with rights deals expiring soon, including the NFL&apos;s, TV programmers are eager to preserve as much goodwill as possible going into those negotiations. </p>
<p>
     The majority of owners in the major American leagues are wealthy enough that they will be able to absorb a hit without having to dump assets. &quot;I don&apos;t think we should be having a bake sale for the owners,&quot; said the former chairman of Fox Sports, David Hill. </p>
<p>
     Experts aren&apos;t expecting a fire sale of franchises valued in the billions. But for anyone who was considering cashing out in the near term, the uncertainty created by the coronavirus could be a powerful argument against it. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I don&apos;t know if there will be any inventory going forward,&quot; said Steve Horowitz, a partner at a leading sports investment bank, Inner Circle Sports. &quot;But if an NFL or NBA team came on the market tomorrow, the list of interested people would still be long -- and none of them would look back with any regret.&quot; </p>
<p>
     That could be a different story across the Atlantic, where there is so much professional soccer that many teams were clinging to survival even before the pandemic. Lower-tier clubs already have called on the lavishly funded Premier League to organize a bailout. At least a dozen teams operating on paper-thin margins could face bankruptcy without one. In a letter to club heads around Europe on Thursday, Andrea Agnelli, chairman of Italian giant Juventus, called the situation &quot;the biggest challenge our game and industry has ever faced.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are all football executives responsible for the well-being and sustainability of the clubs we manage, which are faced with a real existential threat,&quot; he said. &quot;No one is immune, and timing is of the essence.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Women&apos;s sports also could be among the biggest losers. After a banner 12 months that saw female athletes command record television audiences and make big strides in their fight for equal pay, this is the worst possible time to go dark. The U.S. women&apos;s national soccer team planned to capitalize on its 2019 World Cup victory by seizing the spotlight at the Tokyo Olympics and building a more sustainable domestic professional league. </p>
<p>
     As baseball, basketball and hockey try to figure out what the rest of 2020 looks like, so far it is business as usual for the NFL. The heavyweight American sports league struck a new long-term labor agreement with its players earlier this month and now turns its attention toward new TV deals, even though the current pacts still have a few seasons left on them. </p>
<p>
     While talks between the networks and their current rights holders are still in the preliminary stage, the NFL doesn&apos;t believe the current health crisis will have any impact on its future contracts, one network executive said. These conversations are continuing apart from the threat poised to disrupt the 2020-21 season and the potential financial impact of lost games. These rights deals are seen as post-pandemic business by the NFL -- at least for now. </p>
<p>
     One lesson of the pandemic, however, is how quickly things change. Hours after the NBA suspended its season, ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro met with the company&apos;s executives to discuss how the virus might disrupt the network&apos;s schedule. Then, they found out the season was on hold when they read the news on their own network. The next day, ESPN&apos;s programming team scrawled various hypotheticals on a white board to fill the gaps in the schedule. Could they get the rights to air WrestleMania from World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.? What about airing a seven-hour marathon of Tom Brady game footage? Was the network&apos;s new documentary on Michael Jordan ready to release early? </p>
<p>
     NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has spoken several times with Mr. Pitaro and WarnerMedia News and Sports Chairman Jeff Zucker since then, and some network executives are optimistic that the NBA season can still be concluded this year. One scenario floated in conversations is the possibility of televising the NBA playoffs without spectators to protect players and fans from contracting the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban predicts there will be a premium on content from sports leagues like the NBA when there are games again. As people around the world exhaust their Netflix queues, and with the production of movies and television shows effectively shut down, he expects there will be enormous demand for something new to watch. NBA games could help solve that problem. </p>

Sports Industry Reels From Coronavirus Fallout -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     &quot;People will literally be doing anything to watch us,&quot; he said in an email. &quot;They won&apos;t even necessarily be basketball fans. They just will be starving for new content, and we will be there to feed them.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For now, the broadcasters&apos; pain is obvious in their threadbare TV schedules. CBS had been gearing up for its two showpiece events of the spring in the NCAA Tournament and the Masters. Now it is offering viewers the cold comfort of police procedurals. NBC Sports&apos; weekend schedule would normally be packed with live English soccer. Instead it aired reruns of dog shows. </p>
<p>
     The networks might have the opposite problem in the fall: too much inventory. The Kentucky Derby has been delayed from the first Saturday in May to September. The French Open was moved from June to October. The NBA playoffs could last until the late summer and overlap with the start of the NFL and college-football seasons. All that is based on speculative assumptions that severe control measures will be effective, transmission will slow in the summer and the virus won&apos;t wreak havoc in the fall. </p>
<p>
     There is a growing sense that the global sports hiatus could be an opportunity to do things differently when the games return. Some are asking whether the baseball season really needs to be 162 games long or if the NBA calendar should be pushed back two months so that it doesn&apos;t conflict with the NFL&apos;s. </p>
<p>
     One innovative idea came from Wayne Rooney, the former Manchester United forward, who proposed shifting the entire European soccer calendar to operate January to October instead of August to May for a couple of seasons. The idea would be to better line up with the next World Cup, which will be held starting November 2022 in Qatar. </p>
<p>
     The shutdown of sports when Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus and the NBA suspended its season on March 11 was the moment when it hit many Americans that life was about to be very different. The restart of sports might be a signal that the worst is over and the new normal is finally about to begin. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We need sports,&quot; Mr. Cuban said, &quot;as much as sports needs fans.&quot; </p>

<pre>

<p>
  On Friday U.S. stocks ended lower halting a powerful three-session rebound. </p>

<p>

<p>
  At the weekend the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. surged close to 140,000 with the related death toll crossing above 2,400. </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel advisory urging residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days. And President Donald Trump extended social-distancing guidelines through April 30. </p>
<p>
  U.S. official data showed that personal income rose 0.6% on month in February (+0.4% expected) and personal spending increased 0.2% (as expected). </p>
<p>
  The University of Michigan&apos;s Consumer Sentiment Index (final reading) posted at 89.1 in March (90.0 expected). </p>
<p>
  European stocks returned to negative territory as the coronavirus crisis deepened. Following Prince Charles, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock both tested positive for COVID-19 virus. </p>
<p>
  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 3.3%. The U.K.&apos;s FTSE 100 shed 5.3%, Germany&apos;s DAX lost 3.7%, and France&apos;s CAC was down 4.2%. </p>
<p>
  U.S. government bonds received bids, as investors took a cautious stance after stocks rebounded 21% in the prior three sessions. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined to 0.744% from 0.852% Thursday. </p>
<p>
  Spot gold eased 3 dollars to $1,626 an ounce. </p>
<p>
  Oil prices showed continued downward momentum amid reports of rising global oil-storage levels and slumping demand. U.S. Nymex crude oil futures sank 4.8% to $21.51 a barrel, and Brent slid 5.4% to $24.93. </p>
<p>
  On the forex front, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index slid 0.9% on day to 98.36 on Friday, wiping out most of its gains made in the prior week. </p>
<p>
  EUR/USD jumped 1.0% to 1.1142, posted a five-day rally. Later today, the eurozone&apos;s March Economic Confidence Index (93.1 expected) and German CPI (+1.4% on year estimated) will be reported. </p>
<p>
  GBP/USD surged 2.1% to a two-week high of 1.2457. </p>
<p>
  USD/JPY sank 1.5% to 107.90, as investors&apos; risk appetite plummeted. </p>
<p>
  USD/CAD marked a day-high of 1.4155 before closing at 1.3980, down 0.3%. The Bank of Canada lowered its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 0.25% and announced plans to purchase a minimum of 5 billion Canadian dollars government securities per week, intending to provide support to the Canadian financial system and the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>
  Other commodity-linked currencies were broadly higher against the greenback. AUD/USD rallied 1.7% to 0.6166 and NZD/USD advanced 1.3% to 0.6037. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  USD/JPY Intraday: Downside prevails. The pair keeps trading on a down-trend while being capped by the descending 20-period moving average. In fact, a bearish pattern of lower highs in place since March 25 remains intact. Unless the key resistance at 108.20 (around the 50-period moving average) is surpassed, the pair should sink toward 107.00 and 106.50 on the downside. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  EUR/USD Intraday: Further upside. The pair remains on the upside after rebounding from a low of 1.0951 seen last Friday. It is currently trading at levels around the 20-period moving average, which stands above the 50-period one. As long as the level of 1.1075 (around the 50-period moving average) is violated, the bias remains bullish, and the pair should target 1.1190 and 1.1235 on the upside. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  AUD/USD Intraday: Further upside. The pair posted a rebound after touching the rising 50-period moving average. Currently, the prices have crossed above the 20-period moving average. The relative strength index is heading upward, calling for a new up leg. To sum up, above 0.6110, look for an advance with targets at 0.6200 and 0.6250 in extension. On the other hand, breaking below 0.6110 would bring a return with 0.6055 and 0.6020 as targets. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  NZD/USD intraday: Bullish bias remains. Although the pair posted a pullback, it is still support by a rising 50-period moving average. The relative strength index has landed on its neutrality level at 50 and is turning up. To sum up, as long as 0.5972 is not broken, expect a further upside with targets at 0.6081 and 0.6107 in extension. Alternatively, a break below 0.5972 would open a path to 0.5928 on the downside. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  GBP/USD Intraday: Upside prevails. The pair is holding on the upside and is supported by a rising 50-period moving average. The relative strength index is locating at 60s, suggesting the upside momentum for the prices. Hence, as long as 1.2340 acts as key support level, we anticipate a further upside with targets at 1.2560 and 1.2675 in extension. Alternatively, crossing below 1.2340 would call for a pullback with 1.2230 and 1.2140 as targets. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  USD/CHF Intraday: Under pressure. The pair is under pressure below the key resistance level at 0.9560, which should limit the upside room. Besides, the declining 50-period moving average is also acting as resistance now. In this case, as long as 0.9560 is not surpassed, intraday bearish bias remains with down targets at 0.9470 and 0.9440 in extension. Alternatively, a break above 0.9560 would trigger a technical rebound with 0.9600 and 0.9655 as targets. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  USD/CAD Intraday: Towards 1.4115. The pair has broken above a bearish channel drawn from March 25. Currently, support is provided by the 20-period moving average, which is turning upward. The relative strength index stays above the neutrality level of 50, indicating a bullish bias. Unless the key support at 1.3980 is violated, the pair should target 1.4075 and 1.4115 on the upside. Alternatively, below 1.3980, expect a return to 1.3920 on the downside. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  EUR/JPY Intraday: Target 118.41. The pair remains on the downside as it has formed a lower-high. In fact, it has broken below both the 20-period and 50-period moving averages, while the relative strength index has dropped below the neutrality level of 50, signaling a bearish bias. Below the key resistance at 120.26, expect a decline to 118.80 and 118.41. Alternatively, a break above 120.26 would trigger a rebound to 120.92. </p>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  EUR/GBP Intraday: Rebound. The pair maintains a bullish bias above the key support at 0.8907. Currently, it has broken above the 20-period moving average, while the relative strength index has shown a bullish divergence. As long as the key support at 0.8907 holds, the pair should rebound to 0.9025 and 0.9057. Alternatively, a break below 0.8907 would open a path to 0.8853 on the downside. </p>

U.S. Stock-Index Futures, Global Equities and Oil Drop</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Joanne Chiu </pre>
<p>
     U.S. stock-index futures, global equities and oil prices fell after a roller-coaster ride last week that marked the Dow Jones Industrial Average&apos;s biggest weekly gain since 1938. </p>
<p>
     Monday&apos;s declines came after the White House on Sunday extended social-distancing guidelines for another 30 days through the end of April. President Trump said the peak of the death rate from the new coronavirus was expected to hit in two weeks, predicting the U.S. would be on its way to recovery by June 1. </p>
<p>
     Coronavirus cases world-wide topped 678,000, while the death toll surpassed 30,000. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN that projections he has examined showed the disease would kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans and infect possibly millions. </p>
<p>
     In early Monday morning trading in Hong Kong, S&amp;P 500 futures dropped 1.4%, suggesting that U.S. shares could fall at the start of the week. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, a security that is seen as a haven, fell to 0.667%, according to Tradeweb, from 0.744% on Friday. Yields move in the opposite direction of prices. </p>
<p>
     Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, pulled back more than 4% to $26.82 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. crude gauge, fell below $20 a barrel at one point, before recovering slightly to stand 3.7% lower at $20.70 a barrel. That put WTI close to the 18-year settling low of $20.37 that it hit earlier this month. </p>
<p>
     Crude prices have plunged on worries about reduced demand and a price war among major oil producers. </p>
<p>
     Japan&apos;s Nikkei 225 dropped more than 3% in early trading as the yen strengthened 0.3% to 107.57 a dollar. The index logged the best week in its history last week. South Korea&apos;s Kospi Composite retreated more than 2%, while New Zealand&apos;s main equity gauge, the NZX 50, declined more than 1%. Australia&apos;s benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 bucked the downtrend to gain more than 1%. </p>
<p>
     U.S. stocks last week posted their biggest weekly gain since 1938, with the Dow surging 13% and the S&amp;P 500 climbing 10%. But both indexes sold off on Friday, and remain down more than 20% in 2020. Lawmakers in the U.S. agreed to the largest economic-relief package in U.S. history in response to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

USD Sees Volatile Trading, Wiping Prior-Week Gains -- Charting Forex</headline>
<text>
<pre>
 
  By Trading Central 
 </pre>
<p>
  The following is a technical analysis of seven major currency pairs for this week: </p>
<pre>
 
USD/JPY 
1st support - 107.00 (major) 
1st resistance - 110.20 (major) 
2nd support - 104.70 (major) 
2nd resistance - 112.25 (major) 
 </pre>
<p>
  USD/JPY (last 107.72): The pair, as shown on a daily chart, has marked a sharp consolidation after touching a recent high of 111.71. Caution is advised. As long as the key support at 107.00 is not violated, the short-term outlook remains bullish, and the pair still stands chances of revisiting 110.20 and 112.25 on the upside. Alternatively, a clear break below 107.00 would open a path toward 104.70 on the downside. </p>
<pre>
 
EUR/USD 
1st support - 1.0950 (major) 
1st resistance - 1.1230 (moderate) 
2nd support - 1.0780 (minor) 
2nd resistance - 1.1350 (moderate) 
 </pre>
<p>
  EUR/USD (last 1.1114): The pair posted a rebound from 1.0630 and crossed above both 20-day and 50-day moving averages. The relative strength index crosses above its neutrality level at 50, calling for a further upside. Therefore, as long as 1.0950 holds on the downside, look for a continuation of bounce with targets at 1.1230 and 1.1350 in extension. Alternatively, only a break below 1.0950 would turn the outlook to bearish and bring a return with 1.0780 and 1.0630 as targets. </p>
<pre>
 
AUD/USD 
1st support - 0.5870 (major) 
1st resistance - 0.6300 (moderate) 
2nd support - 0.5665 (minor) 
2nd resistance - 0.6490 (moderate) 
 </pre>
<p>
  AUD/USD (last 0.6151): The pair posted a V-shaped rebound and crossed above the 20-day moving average. The relative strength index is heading upward, calling for a further bounce. To conclude, as long as 0.5870 is not broken, look for a further upside with targets at 0.6300 and 0.6490 in extension. Alternatively, breaking below 0.5870 would bring a return with 0.5665 and 0.5510 as targets. </p>
<pre>
 
NZD/USD 
1st support - 0.5775 (major) 
1st resistance - 0.6200 (moderate) 
2nd support - 0.5610 (major) 
2nd resistance - 0.6350 (moderate) 
 </pre>
<p>
  NZD/USD (last 0.6039): The pair is sharply rebounding from 0.5465. Currently, the prices have crossed above the 20-day moving average. The relative strength index advocates for a further upside. To sum up, as long as 0.5775 acts as key support level, we anticipate a further bounce with targets at 0.6200 and 0.6350 in extension. On the other hand, below 0.5775, expect a return with 0.5610 and 0.5485 as targets. </p>
<pre>
 
GBP/USD 
1st support - 1.1810 (major) 
1st resistance - 1.2745 (major) 
2nd support - 1.1400 (major) 
2nd resistance - 1.3095 (major) 
 </pre>
<p>
  GBP/USD (last 1.2417): The pair remains on the upside as it has formed a V-shape rebound. Currently, it has rebounded to levels above the 20-day moving average, while the relative strength index has climbed above the neutrality level of 50, suggesting a bullish bias. Unless the key support at 1.1810 is violated, the pair should proceed to 1.2745 and 1.3095 on the upside. Alternatively, below 1.1810, expect a return to 1.1400 on the downside. </p>
<pre>
 
USD/CHF 
1st support - 0.9375 (major) 
1st resistance - 0.9765 (major) 
2nd support - 0.9175 (major) 
2nd resistance - 0.9900 (major) 
 </pre>
<p>
  USD/CHF (last 0.9517): The pair has retreated sharply after a recent rally. Currently, it has broken below both the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, while the relative strength index has dropped below the neutrality level of 50, signaling a bearish bias. Below the key resistance at 0.9765, expect a decline to 0.9375 and 0.9175. Alternatively, a break above 0.9765 would trigger a revisit to 0.9900 on the upside. </p>
<pre>
 
USD/CAD 
1st support - 1.3775 (major) 
1st resistance - 1.4275 (major) 
2nd support - 1.3560 (major) 
2nd resistance - 1.4480 (moderate) 
 </pre>
<p>
  USD/CAD (last 1.4059): The pair stays on the upside despite a modest pull-back. Currently, it is hovering around the 20-day moving average, while has moved further above the 50-period one. The relative strength index remains above the neutrality level of 50, suggesting that the bullish bias persists. As long as the key support at 1.3775 holds, the pair should advance to 1.4275 and 1.4480. Alternatively, below 1.3775, expect a decline to 1.3560. </p>

  SEATTLE, March 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading experts in animal health recently joined forces to provide guidance to veterinary and shelter professionals around the globe on pets and the current pandemic. Brought together by Trupanion, the leader in medical insurance for cats &amp; dogs, the experts spoke on a wide range of topics in response to COVID-19 with the underlying theme that, to date, this is a people-to-people disease and that pet-to-people transmission is unlikely. </p>
<p>
  &quot;The purpose of this webinar was to bring our community together to align in confronting a global enemy through education and fact-based insight,&quot; said Dr. Steve Weinrauch, BVMS, MRCVS, chief veterinary officer at Trupanion, Founder of MightyVet and webinar moderator. &quot;These forces aligned can achieve great things.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Michael Lappin, DVM, PhD, DACVIM (SAIM), and Chair of the WSAVA One Health Committee commented that the current situation is changing not just day by day but minute by minute, but for now, this is a human-to-human disease. </p>
<p>
  &quot;The world opinion right now is there is no evidence that pets can transmit COVID-19 to people,&quot; said Dr. Lappin. </p>
<p>
  Lappin noted that while more data is needed, the potential fomite transmission should be low. To date, there has been no documented transmission from a dog or cat to a human. </p>
<p>
  The original inference that pets may be affected by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-19) causing COVID-19 started when two of 17 dogs in Hong Kong housed with owners with COVID-19 tested positive for the RNA of the virus.  One of the dogs ultimately developed serum antibodies suggesting that subclinical infection did occur.  None of the eight cats isolated in Hong Kong were positive at the time the webinar was recorded and none of the dogs became clinically ill. </p>
<p>
  Shortly after the webinar was recorded, a cat with transient vomiting and diarrhea housed with a COVID-19 patient in Belgium tested positive for RNA of the virus. Studies are ongoing to determine whether the cat was infected with the virus or just exposed from sharing the same environment. </p>
<p>
  Experts in animal welfare and shelter medicine agreed that there is no evidence at this time that pets can transmit COVID-19 to people; yet critical steps must be taken to navigate this unprecedented time. </p>
<p>
  &quot;As soon as this pandemic reared its ugly head, leaders came together, they saw the writing on the wall and immediately mobilized,&quot; said Jim Tedford, president and CEO for The Association for Animal Welfare Advancement (AAWA). &quot;Working together we have come up with global strategies that would work for any animal sheltering organization, anywhere.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Shelter medicine expert, Dr. Julie Levy, also pointed to five critical steps that shelters should be taking as they navigate this unprecedented time, including the need to preserve a shelter&apos;s critical functions. </p>
<p>
  &quot;Animal shelters and animal control officers are first responders to meeting societal needs,&quot; said Dr. Levy, DVM, PhD, DACVIM, DABVP, Fran Marino Endowed Professor of Shelter Medicine Education at the University of Florida. &quot;It&apos;s imperative that we reinforce with policy makers and elected officials that animal shelters, animal control officers, and veterinary clinics are essential services that need to have the opportunity to stay open when shutdowns occur.  However, these organizations should suspend non-emergency activity to support public health initiatives calling for the public and personnel to stay at home.&quot; </p>
<p>
  The webinar, co-hosted by Covetrus, was free and RACE approved for veterinary professionals. More than 10,000 animal health professionals have viewed or registered for the webinar in under 72 hours. To view a playback of the webinar on Facebook visit MightyVet or Not One More Vet. </p>
<p>
  A second webinar to discuss additional information and updates to any new developments will take place the week of March 30, 2020. </p>

Press Release: SHYSHYSHYNexteer Reports 2019 Financial Results</headline>
<text>
<p>
  SHYSHYSHYNexteer Reports 2019 Financial Results </p>
<p>
  Company Continues Diversification &amp; Globalization Across Customers, Products &amp; Footprint; Achieves Strong Bookings &amp; Increasing Backlog, Anticipates COVID-19 2020 Impact </p>
<p>
  PR Newswire </p>
<p>
  AUBURN HILLS, Mich., March 29, 2020 </p>
<p>
  AUBURN HILLS, Mich., March 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Nexteer Automotive today reported annual results for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.  The Company&apos;s 2019 financial results were impacted by various environmental challenges including lower OEM light vehicle production across all regions, led by a decline in China, a GM-UAW labor strike in North America interrupting vehicle production, reduced revenue from a North America customer&apos;s vehicle platform transition and unfavorable foreign currency. </p>
<p>
  Nexteer reported 2019 revenue of US$3.576 billion which was lower by 8.6% when compared with 2018. Profit attributable to equity holders for the year was US$232.4 million, a reduction of 38.8% compared with 2018, largely reflecting the impact of lower revenue. During 2019, Nexteer generated US$117.9 million in cash flow from operating activities less cash used for investing activities and the balance sheet remained strong at December 31, 2019. Nexteer&apos;s Backlog of Booked Business stood at US$26.4 billion at the end of 2019 -- a 4.4% increase year-over-year from 2018. </p>
<p>
  &quot;While the macro environment broadly impacted the automotive industry in 2019, united as a strong and resilient One Nexteer team, we navigated the year&apos;s challenging landscape and continued to position Nexteer for future success.  As a leader in intuitive motion control, we are focused on winning the long game and believe our strategies for profitable growth will benefit Nexteer and our shareholders over the long-term,&quot; said Guibin Zhao, CEO of Nexteer Automotive. </p>
<p>
  Strong Bookings &amp; Backlog </p>
<p>
  Despite headwinds, Nexteer achieved strong performance in bookings, new business conquests and backlog.  Nexteer secured US$7.0 billion in new bookings of which 50 percent were conquest awards. Notable expansion was achieved in Europe with a breakthrough Dual Pinion EPS customer win -- a global first in this EPS architecture -- secured in 2019. Nexteer also grew its backlog to US$26.4 billion. </p>
<p>
  Globalization &amp; Diversification Across Customers, Product &amp; Regions </p>
<p>
  In addition to a solid backlog, Nexteer further diversified across customers, products and markets with 45 customer program launches during the year (compared to 22 launches in 2018).  These programs spanned multiple customers, product lines, and regions -- including Nexteer&apos;s first Brush EPS launch in India, as well as the first EPS launch from Nexteer&apos;s new production facility in Morocco. </p>
<p>
  Nexteer also expanded its global footprint to capitalize on growth opportunities, further globalize engineering expertise, drive efficiencies and enhance customer responsiveness.   Footprint expansion included the opening of the Asia Pacific Technical Center in Suzhou, China in January 2020, as well as a software center in Bengaluru, India and EPS production facilities in Liuzhou and Wuhan, China in 2019.  In addition, Nexteer&apos;s new Morocco facility went from field to factory in 10 months and launched its first EPS program in late 2019. </p>
<p>
  Technology Leadership in Intuitive Motion Control </p>
<p>
  Nexteer earned GM&apos;s PRIME Supplier Status and Ford&apos;s Allied Business Framework (ABF) Supplier status.  Both signify a long-term commitment and strategic collaboration as GM and Ford strive to realize their visions for a Connected, Automated, Shared and Electric (CASE) future. </p>
<p>
  Nexteer is also exploring shuttling goods through a development partnership with a leader in Last Mile Delivery Services.  Nexteer is leveraging its 10 FIT Steering Systems and dual-path processing software for a test fleet application in 2020. </p>
<p>
  In addition, Nexteer teamed with Continental, CNXMotion (a Nexteer-Continental joint venture) and others on an autonomous people mover project.  As announced by Michigan&apos;s Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, on October 22, 2019, the team &quot;will provide a fixed-route shuttle, utilizing three, automated 15-passenger vehicles. There will also be capacity for a &apos;shuttle train,&apos; carrying groups of up to 45 people at one time&quot;. The demonstration will feature Nexteer&apos;s Steer by Wire, software technologies and systems integration expertise. </p>
<p>
  2020 COVID-19 Impact </p>
<p>
  While Nexteer&apos;s annual results focus on its fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the Company is actively monitoring and responding to the rapidly developing worldwide situation regarding COVID-19. </p>
<p>
  The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic as the virus has continued to expand throughout Asia, Europe and North America, with many countries and jurisdictions declaring state of emergencies and implementing public safety actions in an attempt to contain further spread.  The Company has taken commensurate actions outlined by both health agencies as well as complying with country-specific mandates. </p>
<p>
  During the course of February and March 2020 many of the Company&apos;s OEM customers announced plans to temporarily close their production facilities in China, Europe and North America.  As a result, the Company is coordinating closely with each of its impacted customers and is adjusting production at its manufacturing and supporting facilities in the United States, Mexico, China, Poland and elsewhere as necessary. </p>
<p>
  Nexteer is unable to predict additional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at this time due to the dynamic situation and undefined impacts on afflicted regions&apos; economies as well as the inherent difficulty in predicting potential impact on the Company&apos;s facilities, employees, customers, suppliers and logistics providers. </p>
<p>

U.S. Extends Social-Distancing Guidelines Until End of April -- 7th Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus, Andrew Restuccia and Jennifer Calfas </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Sunday said he was extending the administration&apos;s social-distancing guidelines for another 30 days through the end of April, after saying for days that he was hoping to open up the country in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump, speaking at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, said the peak of the death rate from the new coronavirus was expected to hit in two weeks. Mr. Trump predicted the country would be on its way to recovery by June 1. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s very important that everybody strongly follow the guidelines.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The administration earlier had announced a 15-day program that instructed all Americans to avoid nonessential travel, sit-down restaurants and gatherings of more than 10 people, among other steps. Governors and mayors nationwide have rolled out their own restrictions, shutting schools and many retail businesses. </p>
<p>
     Monday will mark the 15th day of the program. The president said his earlier comments that he hoped to reopen the U.S. by Easter on April 12 were &quot;just an aspiration.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump extended the guidelines as coronavirus patients besieged hospitals in New York and other cities and the U.S. death toll from the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus surged past 2,400 over the weekend, according to Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 800 of the deaths were in New York City, the American epicenter of the pandemic, and New York state&apos;s total death toll surpassed 1,000 on Sunday, according to city and state figures. </p>
<p>
     The global death toll quintupled over the past two weeks to 33,881 on Sunday, with more than two-thirds of the fatalities in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins. Deaths reached nearly 10,800 in Italy, which has suffered the most fatalities. </p>
<p>
     Public-health experts have said extended social distancing is needed until the U.S. develops a vigorous testing regime to identify and isolate cases. Widespread testing is still a long way off and labs now are struggling with supply issues that are further hampering the ability to identify cases. The coronavirus can be spread when people are asymptomatic. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said he didn&apos;t anticipate relaxing the guidelines before April 30 even for regions less affected by the virus. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN Sunday that projections he has examined showed the disease would kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans and infect possibly millions. </p>
<p>
     &quot;What we&apos;re trying to do is not let that happen,&quot; Dr. Fauci said at a White House press conference Sunday. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Fauci and other federal public-health officials have said over 2 million deaths were possible if no social-distancing and other measures were taken. </p>
<p>
     &quot;So, if we can hold that down, as we&apos;re saying to 100,000 -- it&apos;s a horrible number -- maybe even less, but to 100,000 -- so we have between 100,000 to 200,000 -- we all together have done a very good job,&quot; the president said. </p>
<p>
     Both Democratic and Republican party governors highlighted severe shortages of equipment that medical professionals on the front lines need to do their jobs, including masks, face shields and gowns. One particular point of concern is the scarcity of ventilators used to help restore breathing capability among severely stricken patients. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve put in orders with the national stockpile,&quot; said Louisiana&apos;s Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, speaking on CBS&apos;s &quot;Face the Nation.&quot; &quot;But we&apos;ve also pursued manufacturers and vendors trying to place orders for about 12,000 ventilators.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think thus far we&apos;ve received 192,&quot; Mr. Edwards said. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo this weekend joined other states in calling for more supplies and asking for federal coordination. He said states were trying to buy the same supplies from the same companies, bidding up the prices in the process. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Unfortunately we&apos;re competing against every other state in the United States for these same things,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said Sunday. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said the Federal Emergency Management Agency brought 80 tons of personal protective equipment to New York on Sunday, including 130,000 N95 respirators, 1.8 million face masks and gowns and 10.3 million gloves. FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights, and Mr. Trump said he hopes to have 51 flights in total. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Many of the states are stocked up,&quot; Mr. Trump said. &quot;Some of them don&apos;t admit it.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said he was instructing his administration to take steps to provide incentives to keep restaurants open, including instructing the Treasury Department and the Labor Department to examine reinstating corporate tax deductions for the cost of business meals and entertainment. </p>
<p>
     The president called on journalists and state officials to investigate the high volume of protective masks being ordered by hospitals, suggesting hospital workers were mismanaging the supply of masks. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Where are the masks going?&quot; Mr. Trump asked, adding later, &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s hoarding. I think it&apos;s maybe worse than hoarding.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump praised General Motors Co., saying the company was doing a &quot;fantastic job&quot; producing ventilators. His comments came two days after he invoked the Defense Production Act to order the company to make ventilators, accusing GM of &quot;wasting time&quot; in negotiations. &quot;I don&apos;t think we have to worry about General Motors now,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     The number of confirmed American cases surpassed 139,000, the most in the world, according to the Johns Hopkins data. Globally, infections world-wide climbed above 718,000. Dr. Fauci said that there would be millions of cases this year in the U.S. and that infection rates would begin increasing outside of New York soon. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have a very difficult problem here,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re going to see places like Detroit and other cities starting to get into trouble.&quot; </p>
<p>
     New York remained an epicenter in the U.S. Mr. Cuomo said the number of positive cases in the state has risen to nearly 60,000 -- close to half of the nation&apos;s total number of confirmed cases. At least 8,500 people are hospitalized from complications from coronavirus in the state. </p>
<p>
     Other states have moved to limit the number of New Yorkers fleeing their homes there for vacation homes elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis instructed all people entering the state from the New York tri-state area to self-quarantine for 14 days. A violation could mean up to a 60-day jail sentence and fines of up to $500. </p>
<p>
     Other countries also moved to put lockdown measures in place. Italian officials warned that the nation&apos;s strict measures likely will be extended, as data aren&apos;t suggesting the spread of the contagion has reached its peak. In Russia, Moscow authorities ordered an indefinite citywide quarantine, compelling all residents to remain in their homes. </p>
<p>
     By contrast, China, where the virus is believed to have originated, gradually eased the draconian restrictions in central Hubei province that have cut off the flow of goods and people for about two months. </p>
<p>
     Many countries continued to struggle with mask supplies. The French government said Saturday that it was organizing airlift operations to collect masks it has ordered from China amid acute shortage in France. </p>
<p>
     In India, the government worked to stop desperate migrant workers from leaving cities, warning they could be sent to quarantine camps and assuring that food and other staples would be provided for those who have lost jobs. The government shut down nonessential businesses and ordered people to stay home, mirroring efforts elsewhere. </p>
<p>
     Across Africa, coronavirus curfews and lockdowns have taken a violent turn as countries seek to contain the spreading virus. Confirmed cases in Africa have reached 4,282, from just around 800 a week ago. In Kenya, police fired tear gas at a crowd who were trying to board a ferry in the port city of Mombasa on Saturday, causing a stampede in which dozens of people were injured. </p>

New York Extends Order Against Gatherings, Nonessential Business -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jimmy Vielkind </pre>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday said nonessential businesses must remain closed and that gatherings will be banned until April 15 as the death toll from the new coronavirus surged over the weekend. </p>
<p>
     Almost 450 people around the state died from the disease between Friday and Sunday, Mr. Cuomo said at an afternoon briefing, bringing the overall toll above 1,000 -- the highest for any state in the nation. The total includes a New York Police Department detective as well as several health care workers. </p>
<p>
     As of Sunday, 59,513 people were infected with the virus in the state, representing an increase of more than 7,000 in a single day. One of the new patients is Patrick Foye, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who has been working from home, the agency said in a statement. </p>
<p>
     The Democratic governor said the state was still working to increase hospital capacity in preparation for the peak of infections, which officials estimate is at least two weeks away. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said a temporary hospital was being built in part of Central Park in Manhattan and will be completed Tuesday. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo said he was extending a series of executive orders that ban gatherings of any size, keep nonessential government workers at home and close nonessential businesses past Easter, on April 12, and Passover, which begins April 8. The orders had different end dates, and are now all effective until April 15. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Density is the enemy here, for this particular time,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said. </p>
<p>
     He said restrictions had helped slow the spread of the coronavirus i n earlier hot spots, including the Westchester County city of New Rochelle. State officials said Lawrence Garbuz, a 50-year-old lawyer who was one of the first cases in the county, had been released from the hospital. </p>
<p>
     In an executive order signed Saturday, Mr. Cuomo postponed the Democratic presidential primary and several special elections from April 28 to June 23. The state also ordered that women giving birth in hospitals could be joined by a partner. Some hospital systems had previously banned visitors, even for women in labor. </p>
<p>
     The weekend also featured a back-and-forth between President Trump, Mr. Cuomo and leaders of other states over whether there should be travel restrictions on people who have been in or around New York City, site of more than half of the state&apos;s cases. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump on Saturday said he was considering an &quot;enforceable quarantine&quot; for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, but his administration instead issued a &quot;strong travel advisory&quot; for the area. Mr. Cuomo said the advisory was &quot;consistent with everything we&apos;re doing.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo last week ordered state police to stop drivers with New York license plates as they entered the state and specifically ordered New Yorkers to self-quarantine for 14 days upon entering the state. On Saturday, Ms. Raimondo signed a new executive order extending the self-quarantine requirement to people from any state. </p>
<p>
     Some upstate New York counties have told downstate residents not to travel there, even if they have second homes. Rensselaer County Executive Steve McLaughlin, a Republican, signed an order Friday requiring any visitors from New York City, Long Island, Westchester or Rockland counties to register with officials and quarantine for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you&apos;re doing this to escape New York -- you&apos;re trying to get out of a hot zone. I understand,&quot; Mr. McLaughlin said. &quot;But don&apos;t come to an area and potentially infect it. Keep the area you escaped to as safe as you can.&quot; </p>
<p>
     State lawmakers also continued talks around a state budget which must be in place by March 31. Democratic leaders of the state Assembly and Senate said Sunday they would pass resolutions allowing legislators to vote remotely. </p>
<p>
     Discussion continued about Mr. Cuomo&apos;s plan to reduce Medicaid spending by $2.5 billion, something he first proposed in January as essential to plugging a $6.1 billion deficit. </p>

<p>
  CARBO Ceramics Announces Agreement with Wilks Brothers to Acquire Business and Strengthen Financial Position </p>
<p>
  Parties Initiate Consensual, Voluntary Chapter 11 Process to Facilitate Ownership Change and Recapitalization, with Financing Commitment </p>
<p>
  PR Newswire </p>
<p>
  HOUSTON, March 29, 2020 </p>
<p>
  HOUSTON, March 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- CARBO Ceramics Inc. (&quot;CARBO&quot; or &quot;the Company&quot;) today announced that it has reached an agreement with Wilks Brothers, LLC and Equify Financial, LLC (together, the &quot;Wilks Brothers&quot;) under which the Wilks Brothers will acquire the Company through a debt-for-equity exchange pursuant to a plan of reorganization in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. To facilitate the agreement and effectuate the transaction, the Company initiated a voluntary Chapter 11 process in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. CARBO expects to continue to operate in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process. </p>
<p>

<p>
  &quot;Like many companies with a significant concentration in the oil and gas industry, we have felt the impact of the challenging business environment and, in response, have worked diligently to strengthen our overall financial foundation,&quot; said Gary Kolstad, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. &quot;While CARBO has undoubtedly made progress in our transformation strategy, we ultimately expect these headwinds to persist. Accordingly, we are pleased to reach an agreement with the Wilks Brothers; we are excited by their belief in the promise of CARBO&apos;s business and their commitment to our future. We are confident that, under their ownership and investment, we will be better positioned to maximize value, realize the potential of CARBO and serve our customers as we move forward.&quot; </p>
<p>
  The Wilks Brothers have committed to providing $15 million in debtor-in-possession (&quot;DIP&quot;) financing and consented to the use of its cash collateral to bolster CARBO&apos;s financial position and finance its operations through the process. This financing, combined with CARBO&apos;s usual operating cash flows, will allow CARBO to continue to operate in the ordinary course through the restructuring process. </p>
<p>
  &quot;We have long believed in the underlying strength of CARBO&apos;s business, as exemplified by our multi-year relationship with the Company,&quot; said Matt Wilks for Wilks Brothers, LLC. &quot;This transaction will allow us to invest in the future of CARBO as we pursue opportunities to unlock value and support growth.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Consummation of the plan and the restructuring is subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court. Additional information about CARBO&apos;s Chapter 11 cases can be found at http://dm.epiq11.com/Carbo or by calling (866) 977-0978 in the U.S. or +1 (503) 520-4410 internationally. </p>

HQ Trivia Returns Thanks to Anonymous Investor -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Sarah E. Needleman </pre>
<p>
     The mobile quiz app HQ Trivia returned Sunday night thanks to an anonymous investor who provided the funding it needed to resume operations, the show&apos;s host said during the live program. </p>
<p>
     A push notification alerted people with the app on their devices that it would return at its usual time of 9 p.m. ET. Financial details of the deal couldn&apos;t be determined. </p>
<p>
     HQ Trivia, which launched in 2017, abruptly shut down in February and laid off roughly 25 workers after struggling for months with rising costs and declining viewership. Rus Yusupov, co-founder of HQ Trivia, said a few days later on Twitter the show could soon return in a &quot;new home,&quot; but that didn&apos;t happen until now. </p>
<p>
     Last week, the game&apos;s Twitter feed posted an ellipsis, possibly a hint to fans that a comeback was pending, in its first tweet since Feb. 22. </p>
<p>
     Moments before its return Sunday night, host Matt Richards said in a message to The Wall Street Journal: &quot;I just hope I can make people smile cause things have been pretty sucky lately!&quot; </p>
<p>
     HQ Trivia grew quickly in popularity by persuading mobile users to log in at specific times twice a day for a chance to win cash prizes. At one point, HQ Trivia was drawing millions of players daily, with each episode offering 15 minutes of multiple-choice questions covering a range of topics. </p>
<p>
     Technical glitches and challenges in raising funds to cover the game&apos;s prize pools eroded its popularity over time, as well as the 2018 death of HQ Trivia co-founder Colin Kroll. </p>
<p>
     Since the game show ended, fans have expressed dismay over its demise on social media. </p>
<p>
     More recently, people have remarked on how its revival would be ideal now given that so many people are staying home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. On March 11, one person tweeted: &quot;Quarantine seems like a really good time to play a live mobile game show where you answer trivia questions on your phone to win cash. Somebody should make that.&quot; </p>

A Challenging Time for Recyclers: First, China&apos;s Ban. Now, Coronavirus -- Journal Report</headline>
<text>
<pre>
Nina Trentmann </pre>
<p>
     Waste Management Inc. is dealing with an extraordinary amount of change in its recycling business. Two years ago, China decided to ban imports of mixed paper and plastic and introduced limits for scrap metal, upending global recycling markets. The disruption forced Waste Management, the largest residential recycler by volume in the U.S., to re-examine its strategy. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s shift has removed a major source of demand for recyclables, driving down their prices. It also resulted in higher processing costs, as many countries around the world followed the Chinese example and set higher quality standards for imports of recycled goods. Waste Management responded by asking municipalities to pay more for recycling services, the so-called fee-for-service strategy. </p>
<p>
     With that transition still in progress, the new coronavirus struck. The Wall Street Journal spoke with Devina Rankin, Waste Management&apos;s finance chief, about the company&apos;s new strategy and how it has been affected by the pandemic. Edited excerpts follow. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: How has China&apos;s decision to stop taking some recycled goods affected the economics of recycling? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: At the peak, approximately 30% of our recycled commodities were going to China. Today, it&apos;s below 3%. We certainly saw downward pressure on commodity prices. [For an average recyclable-commodities mix, which includes plastic, cardboard, mixed office papers, newspapers, metal and aluminum], as an example, our peak rates in 2017 were around $140 per ton, and today, we are at around $39 per ton. That imbalance in the supply-demand equation drove a fundamental shift in the marketplace that we think could persist. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What is Waste Management doing about low prices for recyclables? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: We&apos;ve made great strides on moving forward with that fee-for-service model and are seeing tremendous value from that. In 2019, our impact to the revenue line from declining commodity values was over $300 million, and in spite of that, we were able to manage the overall profitability of the business to essentially flat. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: How is your effort to make communities pay for more for your service going? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: You have to think of our customers in segments. When we have really short-lifecycle customer contracts, where the customer comes to us on a day-to-day basis, we can renegotiate the rate on a very real-time basis based on changes we&apos;re seeing in market dynamics. </p>
<p>
     On the residential side, we tend to have longer-term contracts, three to five years, sometimes even 10 years. While we can proactively engage with the customer and talk about the changing dynamics that we&apos;ve seen, there&apos;s not necessarily going to be great receptivity [to renegotiate terms while a contract is still running]. The customer says, &quot;We want to wait until our contract is up so that we can renegotiate.&quot; We&apos;re kind of halfway through that process, but because of the duration of some of our contracts, there&apos;s going to be a long tail getting all the way through. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Are communities cutting back on recycling if prices increase? What is the company doing to try to convince municipalities and residential customers to keep recycling even though there might be an increase in price? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: What we have seen is that communities remain fairly steadfast in their commitment to recycling. I think that larger communities are going to be better equipped to really stand behind that commitment because it will be shared by more people in terms of the incremental costs. What we can do is give communities information and insight about the environmental value and benefits that are created from our recycling program. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Where is all this recycling going? What happens now that Waste Management can no longer export recyclable products to China? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: Waste Management has successfully identified alternative outlets for all of its recycled content. The Waste Management volumes redirected from China have been distributed to customers in India, other Southeast Asian countries and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Is there a price per ton for recycled goods where you would say this is no longer economically viable? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: We&apos;ve not seen something in terms of commodity prices that makes us change our view on the viability of the business in the long term. With our focus on operating more efficiently and providing the service for a fee, we think the dynamics of the model have shifted enough that we will continue to make it economically viable. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Falling commodity prices aren&apos;t the only challenge for the recycling industry. An increase in aspirational recycling -- people who want to recycle but recycle the wrong things -- is another, right? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: Cities are pushing all of us to put less in the trash bin and more and more into the recycle bin. We all think it is the right thing. But sometimes it&apos;s not informed. </p>
<p>
     My favorite example is the baby stroller. There was a meeting once with some customers and community officials, where one of the community officials believed that a baby stroller should be recyclable because it had plastic and metal components. But today&apos;s recycling processes are not set up to deconstruct that baby stroller. So what we have to do is start with education. </p>
<p>
     We have education programs with schools and communities, and we use mailers and our website to inform people. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: How much do higher contamination levels cost you? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: If we look at our gross operating expense, we have seen that go up to about $75 per ton of recyclable material, a 10% increase over the last couple of years. You have to slow down the sorting process at our plants to adjust for the higher contamination levels, increasing our labor, machinery and equipment costs as well as increasing the cost to dispose of the waste that we are pulling from the recycling stream. The idea would be with the help of technology to bring it down again. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What is your company doing in terms of improving the recycling process at the new recycling plant in Chicago? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: The traditional recycling model uses sorters and employees to go through a process of pulling out the contaminated goods -- the nonrecyclable plastic or the greasy takeout box. In our new configuration, our equipment can sort and identify recycled content and allow the contamination to flow through as residue. We have been running test materials through the facility over the last few months, and we expect to be fully operational by the end of the second quarter. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What is happening in your recycling business since the coronavirus crisis? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: The volumes there seem to be holding strong. What we are seeing is a transfer of waste from our commercial customers to our residential customers. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Have you seen a change in terms of commodity prices for recycled goods? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: We have seen the domestic demand hold up and even to some extent increase from third parties who use recycled content in their manufacturing processes. That is impacting commodity prices and driving them higher. We see that as something that might benefit the near term. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Are conversations with municipalities about paying more for recycling as a service continuing, given that municipalities don&apos;t have a lot of visibility into what their finances might be looking like in a few months&apos; time? </p>
<p>
     MS. RANKIN: In this current environment, we&apos;re not going to be focused on actively pursuing contract renegotiations. That&apos;s not the right thing for us to be doing. We&apos;re going to be focusing on taking care of our customers with a sensitivity that&apos;s appropriate, given what everyone has on their plate. </p>

Behind Roku&apos;s Ad-Supported Streaming Strategy -- Journal Report</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Patience Haggin </pre>
<p>
     Connected-TV giant Roku Inc. is betting big on ad-supported streaming. With millions of people suddenly sequestered at home, it may be just the right time. </p>
<p>
     Streaming hours are up. Viewers spent about 40% more time streaming both ad-supported and subscription TV March 16 through 22, compared with the previous week, according to data from Vizio Inc., a competing streaming-content service and maker of smart TVs. </p>
<p>
     Roku declines to share data or discuss whether the streaming boom has benefitted ad-supported content. But, in 2019, its monetized video-ad impressions more than doubled, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>
     The filings also show that Roku added viewers, reported higher time spent viewing and increased its revenue per viewer. </p>
<p>
     Like Apple TV, Roku offers a plug-in device that lets you watch any streaming service, including the Roku Channel, launched in 2017. The channel is also available through an app for computers and mobile devices. </p>
<p>
     Roku has pioneered new ad formats designed for streaming video. Last fall, the company started placing pop-up interactive banners over some commercials, giving users a way to interact with the ad. One example: a coupon that earned viewers a discounted movie-rental credit from Fandango. </p>
<p>
     Chief Marketing Officer Matthew Anderson discussed Roku&apos;s strategy. Edited excerpts follow: </p>
<p>
     THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: What changes in viewing habits have you seen in the past few weeks? </p>
<p>
     MR. ANDERSON: The first big change is a big increase in viewing hours in the middle of the day. Traditionally, you&apos;d have TV viewing that was very heavy in the morning and very heavy in primetime. We&apos;re seeing that between noon and six is showing the largest increases. Primetime still remains the largest overall hours. </p>
<p>
     After news, we&apos;re seeing other categories that have been up. The whole area of fitness and well-being has gone up. Spirituality and uplifting programming is increasing, and programming that has to do with education, learning, projects you can do with your kids. </p>
<p>
     People are using time particularly later in the day as a real break, watching things that are just entertaining, sometimes very lighthearted programming, sometimes family oriented. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: If those are some of the shifts, what is Roku doing about it? </p>
<p>
     MR. ANDERSON: We&apos;ve put together an umbrella initiative that we&apos;re calling Home Together [launched last week] to help people find programming relevant to being at home with your family. A big portion of that has been to work with our partners to make more video available for free. We went to a lot of our top premium-subscription partners, like Showtime or Smithsonian, and we&apos;ve gotten extended free viewing periods or extended free trials. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: So far, many of the most popular streaming services have been ad-free. Yet Roku&apos;s media business is betting on ad-supported streaming video. Why is the company confident that consumers want to go back to watching ads? </p>
<p>
     MR. ANDERSON: Overall, I think streaming will support each of the business models in media. But some parts of the industry have overlooked just how compelling free TV is to many consumers. The opportunity to watch something without having to pay additionally is something that we see can build a very, very big audience. We think that essentially free TV will co-exist alongside some transactions like rentals and subscriptions. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: The ad load for digital TV is lighter than it is for traditional TV. How many ads are people willing to watch in streaming video? </p>
<p>
     MR. ANDERSON: When we launched the Roku Channel, we made a very deliberate decision to have about half the ad load of traditional TV. And today about 70% of Roku customers regularly stream free TV or ad-supported video on demand. Every family has the point up to which they want to spend on subscriptions, and they supplement with free TV. </p>
<p>
     Using software allows us to innovate a lot more quickly. A big part of my focus overall is just to spend as much time as I can with streamers and customers to find out either: What&apos;s the thing that they want the most? Or, what&apos;s the pain point that we can remove or take away? </p>
<p>
     WSJ: You make a lot of money off ads. Several other ad-supported businesses like Facebook are warning that with the economic downturn, they expect a lot of brands will pare back their marketing budgets. Is Roku seeing that? </p>
<p>
     MR. ANDERSON: It&apos;s not about the amount of money that&apos;s being spent, it&apos;s the options or solutions that many CMOs are thinking about. </p>
<p>
     A lot of people have invested heavily in sports [advertising] and those sports are not happening right now. Is there a way of reaching people who are no longer accessible via [traditional] sports? What we&apos;ve seen is that some of the people who were sports viewers in February are streaming things like news, films and lifestyle content. So they&apos;re still very, very much engaged. </p>
<p>
     Second, I&apos;ve heard from a number of chief-marketing-officer peers that in some cases people are very much wanting to advertise, but their creative ad may feel less appropriate. Imagine if your ad is about young people being out together or something. You couldn&apos;t really run that ad without it feeling like it wasn&apos;t reflecting the situation that people are in now. </p>
<p>
     One solution that our ad team has done is we have these interactive pop-up overlays that could go over an ad. So, hypothetically, if it were a restaurant ad that showed people enjoying it, you could do an interactive overlay that said, &quot;Here&apos;s a link to a home delivery service&quot; or something that bridges your creative ad. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Every Roku contains trackers sending data on what you watch to companies including Google and Facebook. Do you think that consumers are concerned about their TVs watching them? </p>
<p>
     MR. ANDERSON: I would want you to be very, very clear that the TV is not physically watching anybody, given concerns that that&apos;s happening. </p>
<p>
     As a platform, we&apos;re able to build in things like opting in and opting out, and we are very well-placed to give the user a lot of control over what they choose and what information we are able to use or not. With things like More Ways to Watch, we&apos;ve made it very clear what the benefit is if you opt in. [It recommends shows based on what you&apos;re watching.] We find that the vast majority of people are interested in getting that. We have things where you&apos;re able to adjust a setting where you can limit ad-tracking. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: How many people opt out of Roku&apos;s ad tracking? </p>
<p>
     MR. ANDERSON: We don&apos;t disclose what those rates are. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: You&apos;ve also created an app ecosystem that opens the doors for amateur streaming content. Have consumers been embracing those channels? </p>
<p>
     MR. ANDERSON: If you are someone who is an absolute fanatic about any subject from French-language-teaching to barbecue to something else, or you&apos;re a local news station or a radio station, you can now create a channel on Roku. </p>
<p>
     Sometimes those specialist channels or niche channels don&apos;t have an enormous audience, but the people who are really passionate about them do stream a lot. A good example would be, say, non-English-language content. I was watching the NASA Channel the other day. A lot of universities are creating channels. What it&apos;s doing is democratizing the ability for people to launch a channel. </p>
<p>
     We&apos;re able to work in partnership with smaller channels -- like a channel that focuses on Westerns or history or something like that -- and to bring them pretty big audiences because we&apos;re able to aggregate content and display it in a way that will be interesting for the individual viewer. So if we understand that you are interested in John Wayne, well, we can then pull Westerns into the Roku Channel and you can stream Duke or whatever it is to your heart&apos;s content. </p>

States Restrict Travelers from Coronavirus &apos;Hot Zones&apos; -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jennifer Calfas and Talal Ansari </pre>
<p>
     Local governments across the country are imposing travel restrictions on people from hot-spots of the new coronavirus in the U.S., forcing them to self-isolate, stopping vehicles with out-of-state plates and urging them to stay away. </p>
<p>
     Governors in Rhode Island, Florida and Texas, among others, have tightened restrictions on out-of-state travelers. In particular, they have targeted those coming from New York, the pandemic&apos;s U.S. epicenter, and surrounding states. State leaders say the measures are needed to combat the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>
     In states like Rhode Island and Florida, state police and members of the National Guard have been pulling over out-of-state drivers, asking for their destination and ordering them to self-quarantine, among other methods used to enforce the new measures. </p>
<p>
     The number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in the U.S. on Sunday surged past 135,000, tens of thousands more than those reported in other hard-hit countries such as Italy, China and Spain. Nearly 60,000 of the cases come from New York. Neighboring New Jersey has reported 13,300 infections, the second-highest of any state. </p>
<p>
     President Trump had floated the possibility of a quarantine on New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut, but walked back the idea Saturday. Mr. Trump cited New Yorkers fleeing to Florida as a reason for the potential measure. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They&apos;re having problems down in Florida,&quot; he said Saturday. &quot;A lot of New Yorkers going down.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Instead of a forced quarantine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new advisory urging residents from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to avoid nonessential travel for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Wendy Parmet, a public-health law professor at Northeastern University in Boston, said travel restrictions or measures at the state level can be discriminatory. She said the Constitution gives the power to regulate interstate travel and commerce to the federal government, not the states. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Each state turning into its own fortress is deeply problematic. Certainly it flies in the face of more contemporary understandings of privileges, immunities and right to travel,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s shortsighted.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last week issued an executive order directing travelers from the tri-state area to self-isolate for 14 days. A violation could mean up to a 60-day jail sentence and fines of up to $500. Checkpoints for vehicular traffic were set up on Interstate 10 and 95 into the state. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think it&apos;s an issue when you have folks who are in the hot zone, then leaving the hot zone to come to different parts of the country,&quot; Mr. DeSantis said over the weekend. He said passengers landing at Florida airports would be met by the National Guard and the state health authority to be screened and given instructions about self isolation. </p>
<p>
     On Sunday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, ordered passengers flying to Texas from Miami, Atlanta, Detroit, Chicago, Washington state and California to quarantine for 14 days, expanding a previous order he made for travelers from New York and its surroundings and New Orleans. </p>
<p>
     He also expanded restrictions on travelers by road from any part of Louisiana. Mr. Abbott&apos;s order last week said these measures would be enforced by the state&apos;s Department of Public Safety. Officials would conduct unannounced visits during the 14-day period to designated quarantine sites, like homes or hotels, to ensure those under quarantine orders are complying. Anyone who fails to do so could receive a fine of up to $1,000, 180 days in jail, or both. </p>
<p>
     Rhode Island Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo issued an executive order Saturday mandating that out-of-state visitors self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. A previous executive order targeted residents of New York state specifically. The National Guard will help ensure compliance. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The procedure we have in place does not violate anyone&apos;s Constitutional rights,&quot; said Col. James Manni, head of the Rhode Island State Police, at a press briefing Sunday. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been critical of other states&apos; efforts to identify and track New Yorkers as they cross state lines. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, slammed Rhode Island&apos;s initial order, calling it &quot;reactionary&quot; and said that he would consider suing the state. On Sunday, he thanked Ms. Raimondo for reconsidering. </p>

The Key to Selling Music in the Streaming Age -- From the Man Who Brought You Billie Eilish -- Journal Report</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Anne Steele </pre>
<p>
     John Janick couldn&apos;t have imagined that starting an independent record company from his college dorm room would prepare him for the current heyday of the streaming era. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Janick launched his Fueled by Ramen label as a freshman in 1996, as the music business entered its darkest period of rampant piracy and plummeting CD sales. He built the business by leveraging the internet, going online to seek out fans for his artists, including Fall Out Boy, Panic! At the Disco and Paramore. </p>
<p>
     He went on to lead Warner Music Group&apos;s Elektra Records before Jimmy Iovine recruited him to join Universal Music Group&apos;s Interscope Geffen A&amp;M -- parent of iconic label Interscope Records -- as president and chief operating officer in 2012. Mr. Janick took over from Mr. Iovine as chief executive in 2014. </p>
<p>
     Under Mr. Janick&apos;s tenure, Interscope&apos;s roster has expanded to include hitmakers across pop, rock and hip-hop/R&amp;B. There are the superstars -- Lady Gaga, Madonna, Kendrick Lamar and Eminem. But a lineup of some of the hottest newer artists, including global breakout star Billie Eilish, DaBaby, Summer Walker and the late rapper Juice Wrld, has helped the label dominate the charts over the past year. </p>
<p>
     After five years of retrofitting the company for the streaming era -- combining sales and digital-marketing teams and hiring new employees to reach out to online platforms -- Mr. Janick&apos;s efforts have paid off: Interscope has climbed in market share to become the top-performing label </p>
<p>
     In a conversation with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Janick discussed Ms. Eilish, staying on top in streaming, what&apos;s changed about his job -- and what hasn&apos;t. Edited excerpts follow. </p>
<p>
     A patient approach </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Let&apos;s talk about the Grammys, where Billie swept the four top categories. What strategies on Interscope&apos;s part do you think helped get her there? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: The strategy was patience and then putting her in all the right places at the right time, like getting the season premiere of [&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;]. I think we thought outside the box in the sense that, how were we going to build her in the streaming world? </p>
<p>
     WSJ: How much of this development strategy was about streaming? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: We were a bit ahead of the curve on what we were doing with Spotify and how we were releasing singles and connecting the visuals. It was really about, &quot;How are we thinking about Spotify and Apple and YouTube and Amazon and everybody else?&quot; Consistently putting out records, making sure there was a video with everything, making sure we had the right touring strategy and just building her fan base and streaming. </p>
<p>
     We talked early on -- should we be going to radio with [Ms. Eilish&apos;s breakout SoundCloud hit] &quot;Ocean Eyes?&quot; We purposely didn&apos;t do that. You want to build an artist where kids are talking back to you and help prop up the artist, so by the time you go to certain gatekeepers, it&apos;s somewhat undeniable. </p>
<p>
     On streaming, you have to build everything around it. What&apos;s our strategy in digital advertising, Instagram, TikTok, video? </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Your time at the top of Interscope has tracked along the rise of streaming music. What is the role of a label in building an artist&apos;s career in the age of streaming? What&apos;s changed about the label&apos;s role in this era? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: For Interscope, we&apos;re always looking for career artists. It&apos;s finding those artists that may be slightly left of center. You move people to them instead of moving them to the people. It&apos;s about moving culture. It&apos;s about building a career. When you talk about Billie or DaBaby or Summer or any of these other artists that we&apos;ve broke over the last couple of years, it has been about thinking about the long term of the artist and not taking the shortcuts, because it will all pay off in the end and things become much bigger. </p>
<p>
     Another thing we talk about a lot, which sounds corporate, but it&apos;s actually really protecting the artist, is how you&apos;re building the brand of the artist globally. Before streaming, you would compartmentalize each territory, and you could roll things out and figure out your strategy in each territory. Now, there&apos;s no barriers, so once something is out and it&apos;s happening, it goes everywhere. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: How do you break an artist in the streaming era? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: In the past, you used to be able to have [18-month album] cycles. Now you have to consistently be putting out music. DaBaby has put out an album probably almost every six months for the past few years, and each one just keeps getting bigger and bigger. He&apos;s working his ass off, dropping music constantly, playing shows all the time. Billie, we were dropping a song pretty much every two to three months with a video. That&apos;s what&apos;s worked for them. </p>
<p>
     Tough competition </p>
<p>
     WSJ: With there being this constant deluge of music going up everywhere, on TikTok, on YouTube, on the streaming services, how do you help your artists compete? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: Once you find that right artist and you believe in them, it&apos;s giving them all these resources. We put sales and digital marketing together, because sales was dealing with YouTube and Spotify and Amazon and Apple, but then digital would be marketing on some of these places, too, so they converged. We were one of the first companies to hire playlist people, which sounds obvious, but it was years ago. Just like there are promotion people that go out and talk to radio stations, playlisting people are dealing with editors at all of the different platforms [trying to get artists included on playlists]. </p>
<p>
     It&apos;s all about driving streams. If you&apos;re getting digital marketing right, radio right, connecting it around the globe, it&apos;s going to create more momentum. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What&apos;s different about Interscope&apos;s approach to signing artists in this competitive environment for market share? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: We try to be balanced. We&apos;re not going to sign everything that&apos;s exploding. It might be exciting that something is exploding, but you have to sit with an artist. I always tell people it&apos;s like a marriage. You have to want to sit with those people and not be like, &quot;Well, this one song is working, and we&apos;re going to capitalize on this right now, and we&apos;ll see what&apos;s next.&quot; We always try to project into the future, see the two- to three-year plan of where this person can be. We&apos;re not operating from being desperate in any way. We want to find people that want to work with us every day, and that we want to work with. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: How important is market share, and what is Interscope&apos;s strategy for holding and growing market share? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: Market share is an important piece, especially in the streaming world because there&apos;s a pot of money, and whatever your market share is in streaming, that&apos;s how much money is coming to you. If you have a larger market share, there&apos;s more money coming to you. It can&apos;t all be about market share, but we&apos;re focused on making sure that we&apos;re delivering for our artists, being successful with all the albums. Last year was the highest market share Interscope has ever achieved, and now this year it looks like it&apos;s going to beat what we did last year. We&apos;re focused on it, but it isn&apos;t the sole thing that we&apos;re going toward every day. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: You got into the industry right before the record business came crashing down. What was your approach in that environment in marketing, promoting and supporting artists? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: It&apos;s the same exact thing that I do now. I was a kid in my dorm room, cold-calling people that I would hear a demo from, which at the time would be a CD or a tape, and I was just a passionate person who had no money, so I couldn&apos;t really fly to go see these people, and I would convince them to sign to me over the telephone. </p>
<p>
     But at the core it was the same thing: find things that you&apos;re super-passionate about and do everything possible to break that artist. </p>

It was really about, &quot;How are we thinking about Spotify and Apple and YouTube and Amazon and everybody else?&quot; Consistently putting out records, making sure there was a video with everything, making sure we had the right touring strategy and just building her fan base and streaming. </p>
<p>
     We talked early on -- should we be going to radio with [Ms. Eilish&apos;s breakout SoundCloud hit] &quot;Ocean Eyes?&quot; We purposely didn&apos;t do that. You want to build an artist where kids are talking back to you and help prop up the artist, so by the time you go to certain gatekeepers, it&apos;s somewhat undeniable. </p>
<p>
     On streaming, you have to build everything around it. What&apos;s our strategy in digital advertising, Instagram, TikTok, video? </p>
<p>
     WSJ: Your time at the top of Interscope has tracked along the rise of streaming music. What is the role of a label in building an artist&apos;s career in the age of streaming? What&apos;s changed about the label&apos;s role in this era? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: For Interscope, we&apos;re always looking for career artists. It&apos;s finding those artists that may be slightly left of center. You move people to them instead of moving them to the people. It&apos;s about moving culture. It&apos;s about building a career. When you talk about Billie or DaBaby or Summer or any of these other artists that we&apos;ve broke over the last couple of years, it has been about thinking about the long term of the artist and not taking the shortcuts, because it will all pay off in the end and things become much bigger. </p>
<p>
     Another thing we talk about a lot, which sounds corporate, but it&apos;s actually really protecting the artist, is how you&apos;re building the brand of the artist globally. Before streaming, you would compartmentalize each territory, and you could roll things out and figure out your strategy in each territory. Now, there&apos;s no barriers, so once something is out and it&apos;s happening, it goes everywhere. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: How do you break an artist in the streaming era? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: In the past, you used to be able to have [18-month album] cycles. Now you have to consistently be putting out music. DaBaby has put out an album probably almost every six months for the past few years, and each one just keeps getting bigger and bigger. He&apos;s working his ass off, dropping music constantly, playing shows all the time. Billie, we were dropping a song pretty much every two to three months with a video. That&apos;s what&apos;s worked for them. </p>
<p>
     Tough competition </p>
<p>
     WSJ: With there being this constant deluge of music going up everywhere, on TikTok, on YouTube, on the streaming services, how do you help your artists compete? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: Once you find that right artist and you believe in them, it&apos;s giving them all these resources. We put sales and digital marketing together, because sales was dealing with YouTube and Spotify and Amazon and Apple, but then digital would be marketing on some of these places, too, so they converged. We were one of the first companies to hire playlist people, which sounds obvious, but it was years ago. Just like there are promotion people that go out and talk to radio stations, playlisting people are dealing with editors at all of the different platforms [trying to get artists included on playlists]. </p>
<p>
     It&apos;s all about driving streams. If you&apos;re getting digital marketing right, radio right, connecting it around the globe, it&apos;s going to create more momentum. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: What&apos;s different about Interscope&apos;s approach to signing artists in this competitive environment for market share? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: We try to be balanced. We&apos;re not going to sign everything that&apos;s exploding. It might be exciting that something is exploding, but you have to sit with an artist. I always tell people it&apos;s like a marriage. You have to want to sit with those people and not be like, &quot;Well, this one song is working, and we&apos;re going to capitalize on this right now, and we&apos;ll see what&apos;s next.&quot; We always try to project into the future, see the two- to three-year plan of where this person can be. We&apos;re not operating from being desperate in any way. We want to find people that want to work with us every day, and that we want to work with. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: How important is market share, and what is Interscope&apos;s strategy for holding and growing market share? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: Market share is an important piece, especially in the streaming world because there&apos;s a pot of money, and whatever your market share is in streaming, that&apos;s how much money is coming to you. If you have a larger market share, there&apos;s more money coming to you. It can&apos;t all be about market share, but we&apos;re focused on making sure that we&apos;re delivering for our artists, being successful with all the albums. Last year was the highest market share Interscope has ever achieved, and now this year it looks like it&apos;s going to beat what we did last year. We&apos;re focused on it, but it isn&apos;t the sole thing that we&apos;re going toward every day. </p>
<p>
     WSJ: You got into the industry right before the record business came crashing down. What was your approach in that environment in marketing, promoting and supporting artists? </p>
<p>
     MR. JANICK: It&apos;s the same exact thing that I do now. I was a kid in my dorm room, cold-calling people that I would hear a demo from, which at the time would be a CD or a tape, and I was just a passionate person who had no money, so I couldn&apos;t really fly to go see these people, and I would convince them to sign to me over the telephone. </p>
<p>
     But at the core it was the same thing: find things that you&apos;re super-passionate about and do everything possible to break that artist. </p>

I&apos;ve Worked From Home for 22 Years. Here&apos;s What I&apos;ve Learned -- Journal Report</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Alexandra Samuel </pre>
<p>
     How do you balance productivity with health and well-being when you&apos;re working from home, rather than at the office? </p>
<p>
     It is a question many people are now grappling with for the first time, as Covid-19 closes many workplaces and sends people into the relative isolation of the home office. But in our house, it is business as usual: I&apos;ve worked from home for the most of the past 22 years, and for the past four, my husband and I have worked from home together. (And we still like each other!) </p>
<p>
     But I&apos;ll be honest: The first time I found myself working from home, in my mid-20s, I had a tough time. And since then, to make sure I don&apos;t sink into any more funks, I&apos;ve been very conscientious about staying connected to the outside world, balancing my productivity with what&apos;s good for my mental health. </p>
<p>
     That is more challenging for me now, just as it is for everyone else: I really miss the coffee shop where I usually spend at least three workdays a week. But it is possible, because I already have some basic habits in place that ensure home-based work doesn&apos;t compromise my well-being. </p>
<p>
     Here are my secrets: </p>
<p>
     Let go of the eight-hour day </p>
<p>
     If you&apos;re working in an office, much of your eight-hour &quot;workday&quot; is made up of meetings in which you&apos;re mostly listening, in addition to water-cooler chat, collegial conversations and random interruptions. When I&apos;ve worked at an office, I&apos;ve considered it a good day if I get 4 hours of decent work time. </p>
<p>
     Since my solo workdays are uninterrupted, I can get more done in 5 hours than I&apos;d accomplish in 8 hours at the office. Conversely, if I consistently work more than 5 or 6 hours at a stretch, I can get really burned out and isolated. </p>
<p>
     So I try not to get hung up on whether the clock on the wall says 5 p.m.; my workday ends when I&apos;ve completed the work I need to get done, and if I reach my limit or get restless before then, I take an extended break or get outside for a walk. </p>
<p>
     I also try to book in video or phone calls to make sure I get human interaction. On days when I don&apos;t have many business calls, I try to call at least one friend or family member in the midafternoon, when my productivity starts to flag. If I have brainless tasks like clearing out my inbox or invoicing clients, I take care of that later in the evening, after I&apos;ve had a chance to refresh and interact with some humans. </p>
<p>
     Choose three things a day </p>
<p>
     When you aren&apos;t using the business day to decide when work starts and ends, you need some other structure that lets you know when you&apos;ve put in a day&apos;s work. So I like to pick my top three priorities for each day, and share those three commitments with a colleague (or group of colleagues) early in the day, via chat or email, so I have a sense of accountability for what I get done. I start my day by jotting down major items like: Create the spreadsheet with the list of all the variables for our data project; write first draft of remote-work story; send all outstanding invoices. </p>
<p>
     Sure, you&apos;ll have other emails to address or calls to answer, but those three big things will be the center of your day, and you&apos;ll fit the other stuff in around the edges. At the end of the day, share your accomplishments (even if only one or zero out of three) with the colleagues you&apos;re using as accountability partners. They don&apos;t have to be people you work with; they can be friends who commit to this practice so you all stay sane while working from home. This won&apos;t only help you focus your days, but will give you a sense of community and support for your daily work effort. </p>
<p>
     Choose a new time-management system </p>
<p>
     If you&apos;re going to enjoy the advantages of letting go of the eight-hour day, you need a different way of managing your time and ensuring you&apos;re working at an appropriate pace. </p>
<p>
     Your daily &quot;three things&quot; can be part of that system, but it is also helpful to set up some other structures to help you see where your time goes. The productivity expert Mike Vardy came up with the term &quot;time theming&quot; to describe the idea of committing certain days, times or weeks to specific tasks or types of tasks; you can create a separate &quot;time theming&quot; calendar inside your calendar app, and use that to plan and visualize which parts of the day or week you&apos;re going to spend on different types of work. </p>
<p>
     It also can be very useful to install a time tracker like Timing.app or ManicTime on your computer, which runs in the background and lets you see where your time has gone. You can even build simple rules so that you get visual reports that break your time down into productive vs. unproductive time. Take a look at how you&apos;ve used your time, either once a day or once a week, and it will help you find an appropriate pace that preserves both your productivity and your sanity. </p>
<p>
     Respect and work with your natural energy cycles </p>
<p>
     When you&apos;re working in an office, you have to show up and put in a regular day&apos;s work whether you&apos;re bursting with energy or burned-out and in desperate need of a break. When you&apos;re working from home, you have more flexibility to work with these natural cycles -- as long as you don&apos;t let them rattle you. </p>
<p>
     I used to freak out whenever I hit a solo work slump, like the day or week after a big project or a vacation, when I just couldn&apos;t focus or get much done. During these crisis times, slumps are a little less predictable: Some mornings I wake up really worried, and just can&apos;t focus, but one day this week I went into overdrive, pulled my first all-nighter in a decade, and exhausted myself for the next day. </p>
<p>
     Now I&apos;ve learned to accept these downturns, so instead of worrying that they mean I&apos;ll never again get anything done, I use these natural ebbs to take care of personal tasks (booking a whole bunch of catch-up calls for the day after I finish a big piece of work, or using a listless day to cook a whole bunch of meals for our freezer). Or I use them to take care of those work projects I never have time for when I&apos;m on deadline, like updating my email filters or reorganizing my files. I find these organizing tasks help clear my mind and get me back into the groove of work, so it is easier to get back into the flow of my primary responsibilities. </p>
<p>
     Of course, there are practical reasons why you may not be able to just go offline for a day or even an entire afternoon. What you can do is plan on tackling most of those emails and messages during the windows when you&apos;re in full-on work mode, and then tack on a couple of short surgical strikes at other times in the day or evening, to handle time-sensitive messages that can&apos;t wait for your next work window. </p>
<p>
     Be a regular </p>
<p>
     Until recently, I was a regular at one particular coffee shop, where I know the cafe owners and enough of my fellow regulars to give me a sense of community and a little collegial chitchat. Now that I&apos;m working entirely from home, I try to be a regular in a few different online contexts: Facebook groups, Twitter lists and Slack channels for people in my field and for solo workers, so I have a sense of collegiality and a sounding board for professional issues. </p>
<p>
     Even if you&apos;ve previously been sparing or surgical in the way you use your company&apos;s Slack or Teams conversations, now is the time to start actually hanging out there a little, and maybe even commit to joining in the just-for-fun channels once or twice a day; it will help you stay more connected to your larger team. You could also consider frequenting a few of the broader online communities in your industry or professional field, even if you&apos;ve never done that before; it may be a while before you can go to a trade show or conference, and this will help you build or sustain comparable relationships online. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Seeing&quot; the same people in the same context, day in and day out, provides a vital sense of continuity and community, and makes it possible to dive deeper, into more interesting conversations, because we aren&apos;t starting from square one each day. Those networks are more important than ever now, so I stay logged into several different Slack workspaces and even leave the dreaded notifications turned on! </p>
<p>
     Yes, it is a little distracting, but hearing from clients and colleagues in real time helps me feel like I&apos;m still part of a larger workplace and professional community. </p>
<p>
     Take time to reconnect </p>
<p>
     Whether you come from an office where collegial chitchat is part of the meeting routine, or from a shop with a let&apos;s-get-straight-to-business culture, now is a time to think carefully about how you can build and sustain collegial relationships when you have exactly zero in-person contact. Even if you normally function at a brisk professional distance, you may find that the lack of body-language cues or coffee-line greetings suddenly makes you feel less connected to your colleagues, and frays the unspoken bonds of trust that let us work effectively together. </p>
<p>
     If you can, slow down just a bit now that you&apos;re at home, take a few minutes at the beginning and end of each web conference or video call to just connect with your colleagues as actual humans. Ask them how they are doing, or for their best tips for coping with a cooped-up existence or just share a piece of your own personal news. These little investments in relationships pay enormous business dividends, because people are more effective at collaborating when they trust one another, and actual human conversation builds trust. Just as important, these interactions will make you feel more connected and help combat your own sense of isolation. </p>

I&apos;ve Worked From Home for 22 Years. Here&apos;s What -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     The last time I switched from office work to remote work, I gained 20 pounds in the first year, just because my baseline level of activity went from moderate (walking from parking lot to office, walking from desk to coffee maker, walking out to lunch and back) to zero. Wear a step counter and commit to a minimum daily step count; take a walk early enough in the day that if you haven&apos;t hit your step count, you can plan on running the laundry up and down the stairs a few more times, or find another errand to get yourself moving. </p>
<p>
     Set up mental-health check-ins </p>
<p>
     When you&apos;re working from home -- and especially if you&apos;re doing that while living alone -- it is really crucial to have some kind of structure for checking in on your own mental health and well-being, so you don&apos;t get lost in a sea of work and deadlines. When I returned to working solo a few years ago, I experimented with a few different mood-tracking and daily-reflection apps that prompted me to reflect on my mood and emotional state at least once a day. </p>
<p>
     Now that kind of reflection has become part of my morning ritual: I do a kind of self-scan each morning to see what kinds of emotions are sitting in my body (once you get used to this kind of practice, it really does feel quite physical), and if it seems like I&apos;m low or anxious, I try to exercise earlier in the day and eat more carefully so I don&apos;t ride a blood-sugar roller coaster. I also talk to a therapist every couple of weeks, and my husband and I have an evening check-in every day. </p>
<p>
     Schedule a standing date </p>
<p>
     Just as remote work sets your baseline physical activity to zero, it sets your baseline social interaction to zero (well, not counting anyone you live with). I&apos;ve found it very helpful to have standing dates that ensure I have some social interaction every week, even if I don&apos;t get organized enough to make plans. These days, that consists of a 4 p.m. walk with one or two friends, every single day, so that I get outside and see someone outside my immediate family. (Don&apos;t worry, we practice social distancing.) </p>
<p>
     I also scheduled a standing morning video call with a new colleague. It isn&apos;t something I&apos;d do in a more conventional work situation, but right now, it ensures we both get a focused start to our days, and even more important, it is helping us build a collegial relationship while fighting isolation. </p>
<p>
     Remember, tackling remote work in a healthy way is a skill, just like any other professional skill. It is going to take a little time, and a little practice -- but by prioritizing your well-being, as well as your productivity, you may even discover that you actually prefer working from home. </p>

I&apos;ve Worked From Home for 22 Years. Here&apos;s What I&apos;ve Learned -- Journal Report</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Alexandra Samuel </pre>
<p>
     How do you balance productivity with health and well-being when you&apos;re working from home, rather than at the office? </p>
<p>
     It is a question many people are now grappling with for the first time, as Covid-19 closes many workplaces and sends people into the relative isolation of the home office. But in our house, it is business as usual: I&apos;ve worked from home for the most of the past 22 years, and for the past four, my husband and I have worked from home together. (And we still like each other!) </p>
<p>
     But I&apos;ll be honest: The first time I found myself working from home, in my mid-20s, I had a tough time. And since then, to make sure I don&apos;t sink into any more funks, I&apos;ve been very conscientious about staying connected to the outside world, balancing my productivity with what&apos;s good for my mental health. </p>
<p>
     That is more challenging for me now, just as it is for everyone else: I really miss the coffee shop where I usually spend at least three workdays a week. But it is possible, because I already have some basic habits in place that ensure home-based work doesn&apos;t compromise my well-being. </p>
<p>
     Here are my secrets: </p>
<p>
     Let go of the eight-hour day </p>
<p>
     If you&apos;re working in an office, much of your eight-hour &quot;workday&quot; is made up of meetings in which you&apos;re mostly listening, in addition to water-cooler chat, collegial conversations and random interruptions. When I&apos;ve worked at an office, I&apos;ve considered it a good day if I get 4 hours of decent work time. </p>
<p>
     Since my solo workdays are uninterrupted, I can get more done in 5 hours than I&apos;d accomplish in 8 hours at the office. Conversely, if I consistently work more than 5 or 6 hours at a stretch, I can get really burned out and isolated. </p>
<p>
     So I try not to get hung up on whether the clock on the wall says 5 p.m.; my workday ends when I&apos;ve completed the work I need to get done, and if I reach my limit or get restless before then, I take an extended break or get outside for a walk. </p>
<p>
     I also try to book in video or phone calls to make sure I get human interaction. On days when I don&apos;t have many business calls, I try to call at least one friend or family member in the midafternoon, when my productivity starts to flag. If I have brainless tasks like clearing out my inbox or invoicing clients, I take care of that later in the evening, after I&apos;ve had a chance to refresh and interact with some humans. </p>
<p>
     Choose three things a day </p>
<p>
     When you aren&apos;t using the business day to decide when work starts and ends, you need some other structure that lets you know when you&apos;ve put in a day&apos;s work. So I like to pick my top three priorities for each day, and share those three commitments with a colleague (or group of colleagues) early in the day, via chat or email, so I have a sense of accountability for what I get done. I start my day by jotting down major items like: Create the spreadsheet with the list of all the variables for our data project; write first draft of remote-work story; send all outstanding invoices. </p>
<p>
     Sure, you&apos;ll have other emails to address or calls to answer, but those three big things will be the center of your day, and you&apos;ll fit the other stuff in around the edges. At the end of the day, share your accomplishments (even if only one or zero out of three) with the colleagues you&apos;re using as accountability partners. They don&apos;t have to be people you work with; they can be friends who commit to this practice so you all stay sane while working from home. This won&apos;t only help you focus your days, but will give you a sense of community and support for your daily work effort. </p>
<p>
     Choose a new time-management system </p>
<p>
     If you&apos;re going to enjoy the advantages of letting go of the eight-hour day, you need a different way of managing your time and ensuring you&apos;re working at an appropriate pace. </p>
<p>
     Your daily &quot;three things&quot; can be part of that system, but it is also helpful to set up some other structures to help you see where your time goes. The productivity expert (and former colleague of mine) Mike Vardy came up with the term &quot;time theming&quot; to describe the idea of committing certain days, times or weeks to specific tasks or types of tasks; you can create a separate &quot;time theming&quot; calendar inside your calendar app, and use that to plan and visualize which parts of the day or week you&apos;re going to spend on different types of work. </p>
<p>
     It also can be very useful to install a time tracker like Timing.app or ManicTime on your computer, which runs in the background and lets you see where your time has gone. You can even build simple rules so that you get visual reports that break your time down into productive vs. unproductive time. Take a look at how you&apos;ve used your time, either once a day or once a week, and it will help you find an appropriate pace that preserves both your productivity and your sanity. </p>
<p>
     Respect and work with your natural energy cycles </p>
<p>
     When you&apos;re working in an office, you have to show up and put in a regular day&apos;s work whether you&apos;re bursting with energy or burned-out and in desperate need of a break. When you&apos;re working from home, you have more flexibility to work with these natural cycles -- as long as you don&apos;t let them rattle you. </p>
<p>
     I used to freak out whenever I hit a solo work slump, like the day or week after a big project or a vacation, when I just couldn&apos;t focus or get much done. During these crisis times, slumps are a little less predictable: Some mornings I wake up really worried, and just can&apos;t focus, but one day this week I went into overdrive, pulled my first all-nighter in a decade, and exhausted myself for the next day. </p>
<p>
     Now I&apos;ve learned to accept these downturns, so instead of worrying that they mean I&apos;ll never again get anything done, I use these natural ebbs to take care of personal tasks (booking a whole bunch of catch-up calls for the day after I finish a big piece of work, or using a listless day to cook a whole bunch of meals for our freezer). Or I use them to take care of those work projects I never have time for when I&apos;m on deadline, like updating my email filters or reorganizing my files. I find these organizing tasks help clear my mind and get me back into the groove of work, so it is easier to get back into the flow of my primary responsibilities. </p>
<p>
     Of course, there are practical reasons why you may not be able to just go offline for a day or even an entire afternoon. What you can do is plan on tackling most of those emails and messages during the windows when you&apos;re in full-on work mode, and then tack on a couple of short surgical strikes at other times in the day or evening, to handle time-sensitive messages that can&apos;t wait for your next work window. </p>
<p>
     Be a regular </p>
<p>
     Until recently, I was a regular at one particular coffee shop, where I know the cafe owners and enough of my fellow regulars to give me a sense of community and a little collegial chitchat. Now that I&apos;m working entirely from home, I try to be a regular in a few different online contexts: Facebook groups, Twitter lists and Slack channels for people in my field and for solo workers, so I have a sense of collegiality and a sounding board for professional issues. </p>
<p>
     Even if you&apos;ve previously been sparing or surgical in the way you use your company&apos;s Slack or Teams conversations, now is the time to start actually hanging out there a little, and maybe even commit to joining in the just-for-fun channels once or twice a day; it will help you stay more connected to your larger team. You could also consider frequenting a few of the broader online communities in your industry or professional field, even if you&apos;ve never done that before; it may be a while before you can go to a trade show or conference, and this will help you build or sustain comparable relationships online. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Seeing&quot; the same people in the same context, day in and day out, provides a vital sense of continuity and community, and makes it possible to dive deeper, into more interesting conversations, because we aren&apos;t starting from square one each day. Those networks are more important than ever now, so I stay logged into several different Slack workspaces and even leave the dreaded notifications turned on! </p>
<p>
     Yes, it is a little distracting, but hearing from clients and colleagues in real time helps me feel like I&apos;m still part of a larger workplace and professional community. </p>
<p>
     Take time to reconnect </p>
<p>
     Whether you come from an office </p>
<p>
     where collegial chitchat is part of the meeting routine, or from a shop with a let&apos;s-get-straight-to-business culture, now is a time to think carefully about how you can build and sustain collegial relationships when you have exactly zero in-person contact. Even if you normally function at a brisk professional distance, you may find that the lack of body-language cues or coffee-line greetings suddenly makes you feel less connected to your colleagues, and frays the unspoken bonds of trust that let us work effectively together. </p>
<p>
     If you can, slow down just a bit now that you&apos;re at home, take a few minutes at the beginning and end of each web conference or video call to just connect with your colleagues as actual humans. Ask them how they are doing, or for their best tips for coping with a cooped-up existence or just share a piece of your own personal news. These little investments in relationships pay enormous business dividends, because people are more effective at collaborating when they trust one another, and actual human conversation builds trust. Just as important, these interactions will make you feel more connected and help combat your own sense of isolation. </p>

<headline brand-display="DJ" >
I&apos;ve Worked From Home for 22 Years. Here&apos;s What -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     The last time I switched from office work to remote work, I gained 20 pounds in the first year, just because my baseline level of activity went from moderate (walking from parking lot to office, walking from desk to coffee maker, walking out to lunch and back) to zero. Wear a step counter and commit to a minimum daily step count; take a walk early enough in the day that if you haven&apos;t hit your step count, you can plan on running the laundry up and down the stairs a few more times, or find another errand to get yourself moving. </p>
<p>
     Set up mental-health check-ins </p>
<p>
     When you&apos;re working from home -- and especially if you&apos;re doing that while living alone -- it is really crucial to have some kind of structure for checking in on your own mental health and well-being, so you don&apos;t get lost in a sea of work and deadlines. When I returned to working solo a few years ago, I experimented with a few different mood-tracking and daily-reflection apps that prompted me to reflect on my mood and emotional state at least once a day. </p>
<p>
     Now that kind of reflection has become part of my morning ritual: I do a kind of self-scan each morning to see what kinds of emotions are sitting in my body (once you get used to this kind of practice, it really does feel quite physical), and if it seems like I&apos;m low or anxious, I try to exercise earlier in the day and eat more carefully so I don&apos;t ride a blood-sugar roller coaster. I also talk to a therapist every couple of weeks, and my husband and I have an evening check-in every day. </p>
<p>
     Schedule a standing date </p>
<p>
     Just as remote work sets your baseline physical activity to zero, it sets your baseline social interaction to zero (well, not counting anyone you live with). I&apos;ve found it very helpful to have standing dates that ensure I have some social interaction every week, even if I don&apos;t get organized enough to make plans. These days, that consists of a 4 p.m. walk with one or two friends, every single day, so that I get outside and see someone outside my immediate family. (Don&apos;t worry, we practice social distancing.) </p>
<p>
     I also scheduled a standing morning video call with a new colleague. It isn&apos;t something I&apos;d do in a more conventional work situation, but right now, it ensures we both get a focused start to our days, and even more important, it is helping us build a collegial relationship while fighting isolation. </p>
<p>
     Remember, tackling remote work in a healthy way is a skill, just like any other professional skill. It is going to take a little time, and a little practice -- but by prioritizing your well-being, as well as your productivity, you may even discover that you actually prefer working from home. </p>

U.S. Stock-Index Futures, Global Equities and Oil Drop</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Joanne Chiu </pre>
<p>
     U.S. stock-index futures, global equities and oil prices fell after a roller-coaster ride last week that marked the Dow Jones Industrial Average&apos;s biggest weekly gain since 1938. </p>
<p>
     Monday&apos;s declines came after the White House on Sunday extended social-distancing guidelines for another 30 days through the end of April. President Trump said the peak of the death rate from the new coronavirus was expected to hit in two weeks, predicting the U.S. would be on its way to recovery by June 1. </p>
<p>
     Coronavirus cases world-wide topped 678,000, while the death toll surpassed 30,000. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN that projections he has examined showed the disease would kill between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans and infect possibly millions. </p>
<p>
     In early Monday morning trading in Hong Kong, S&amp;P 500 futures dropped 1.4%, suggesting that U.S. shares could fall at the start of the week. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, a security that is seen as a haven, fell to 0.667%, according to Tradeweb, from 0.744% on Friday. Yields move in the opposite direction of prices. </p>
<p>
     Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, pulled back more than 4% to $26.82 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. crude gauge, fell below $20 a barrel at one point, before recovering slightly to stand 3.7% lower at $20.70 a barrel. That put WTI close to the 18-year settling low of $20.37 that it hit earlier this month. </p>
<p>
     Crude prices have plunged on worries about reduced demand and a price war among major oil producers. </p>
<p>
     Japan&apos;s Nikkei 225 dropped more than 3% in early trading as the yen strengthened 0.3% to 107.57 a dollar. The index logged the best week in its history last week. South Korea&apos;s Kospi Composite retreated more than 2%, while New Zealand&apos;s main equity gauge, the NZX 50, declined more than 1%. Australia&apos;s benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 bucked the downtrend to gain more than 1%. </p>
<p>
     U.S. stocks last week posted their biggest weekly gain since 1938, with the Dow surging 13% and the S&amp;P 500 climbing 10%. But both indexes sold off on Friday, and remain down more than 20% in 2020. Lawmakers in the U.S. agreed to the largest economic-relief package in U.S. history in response to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

Global Wheat Prices Track Higher on Supply Fears -- Market Talk</headline>
<text>
<p>
     0212 GMT - Global wheat prices are tracking higher, partly owing to virus-related containment measures raising fears about future supply, Capital Economics says. &quot;Compared to some other agriculturals, wheat production is particularly labor intensive.&quot; Also, it notes wheat demand has been supported by consumer stockpiling. But Capital Economics adds that once the containment measures are lifted, supply fears will fade and demand will drop back, putting downward pressure on the wheat price. CBOT front-month wheat is flat at $5.72 a bushel, after rising some 7% last week. (lucy.craymer@wsj.com) </p>

Global Economic Outlook Likely Remains Upbeat in Medium Term -- Market Talk</headline>
<text>
<p>
     0227 GMT - Even as a swath of bad economic news approaches, Goldman Sachs remains upbeat on what may come for the global economy in the medium term. The bank thinks there is a good case for a meaningful market rebound later in the year as the nature of the virus shock is temporary. The experience of Asia shows that it should be possible to restart aspects of economic life within a reasonable time frame. The economic policy response may need to expand, but in countries with enough fiscal space it should be possible to bridge economies through the crisis, GS adds.

Base Metals Edge Lower, May Slide Further in Coming Months -- Market Talk</headline>
<text>
<p>
     0236 GMT - Base-metal prices slip in Asian morning trade, alongside equities in the region, as global coronavirus infections continue to rise despite governments&apos; containment measures. Commerzbank expects prices to fall sharply in the coming months, in response to weaker economic data due to disruptions caused by the pandemic. The three-month LME copper contract is down 0.8% at $4,752 a metric ton, while the aluminum contract is 0.1% lower at $1,544 a ton. (martin.mou@wsj.com) </p>

2.   REVENUE AND SEGMENT INFORMATION 
 
     2.1   Revenue from contracts with customers 
 
           The Group contracts with customers, which are generally automotive manufacturers and automotive 
           original equipment manufacturers (OEM), to sell steering and driveline systems and components. 
           In connection with these contracts the Group provides tooling and prototype parts. The Group does 
           not have material significant payment terms as payment is received shortly after the point of sale. 
 
           Performance Obligations 
 
           The following summarises types of performance obligations identified in a contract with a customer. 
 
                                        Nature, timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and 
           Products                     payment terms. 
 
           Production Parts             The Group recognises the majority of revenue for production parts at 
                                        a point in time upon shipment to the customer and transfer of the title 
                                        and risk of loss under standard commercial terms. 
 
                                        A limited number of the Group&apos;s customer arrangements for 
                                        customised products with no alternative use provide the Company 
                                        with the right to payment during the production process. These 
                                        revenues are recognised over time as performance obligations under 
                                        the terms of a contract are satisfied. 
 
                                        The amount of revenue recognised is based on the purchase order 
                                        price. Customers typically pay for the product/prototype based on 
                                        customary business practices with payment terms averaging 47-60 
                                        days. 
 
           Tooling                      The Group&apos;s development and sale of tooling for customers is 
                                        performed in connection with the preparations to produce and sell 
                                        products to its customers. Customers typically pay for the tooling in a 
                                        lump sum upon acceptance. 
 
                                        The Group recognises revenue for tooling over time as it satisfies its 
                                        performance obligation. Revenue is recognised to the extent of costs 
                                        incurred to date for reimbursable tooling from customers. 
 
           Engineering Design and       The Group recognises non-production related engineering design 
           Development/Prototypes       and development revenue, which is normally related to ADAS, 
                                        performance improvement and business pursuit. 
 
                                        The Group recognises revenue for non-production engineering design 
                                        and development/prototypes revenue over time as it satisfies its 
                                        performance obligations. 
 
 
                                                   -8- 
      Contract balances 
 
      The contract assets primarily relate to the Group&apos;s rights to consideration for work completed 
      but not billed at the reporting date on production parts, tooling and engineering design and 
 
      development/prototype. The contract assets are reclassified into the receivables balance when the 
      rights to receive payment become unconditional. There have been no impairment losses recognised 
      related to contract assets arising from the Group&apos;s contracts with customers. Contract liabilities are 
      associated with consideration received from customers in advance of transferring goods promised in 
      a contract. Recognition of revenue is deferred until the related performance obligations are satisfied 
      in the future. The following table provides information about contract assets and contract liabilities 
      from contracts with customers.

      (i)    Contract assets are recorded within other current receivables and prepayments. 
 
      (ii)   Contract liabilities are recorded within deferred revenue. 
 
2.2   Segment information 
 
      The Group&apos;s segment information is presented on the basis of internal reports that are regularly 
      reviewed by the Group&apos;s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in order to allocate resources to the 
      segments and assess their performance. For each of the Group&apos;s reportable segments, the Group&apos;s 
      CEO reviews internal management reports on a quarterly basis. 
 
      The Group classifies its businesses into three reportable segments: North America, Asia Pacific, 
      and Europe, Middle East, Africa and South America (EMEASA). All of the Group&apos;s operating 
      segments typically offer the same steering and driveline products. The &quot;Others&quot; category represents 
      parent company activities of the Company and activities of its non-operating direct and indirect 
      subsidiaries, as well as elimination entries between segments. 
 
      The key performance indicators that the Group monitors to manage segment operations are: 
 
            Operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (including impairment 
             on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets) and share of results of joint ventures 
             (Adjusted EBITDA). 
 
            Total assets and total liabilities represent total current and non-current assets and total 
             current and non-current liabilities of the segments and include assets and liabilities between

7.   EARNINGS PER SHARE 
 
     a.       Basic 
 
              Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the 
              Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. 
 
                                                                                         For the year ended 
                                                                                           December 31,

     b.    Diluted 
 
           Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary 
           shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company&apos;s 
           dilutive potential ordinary shares comprise of shares issued under the share option scheme that are 
           vested as at December 31, 2019. The number of shares that would have been issued assuming the 
           exercise of the share options less the number of shares that could have been issued at fair value 
           (determined as the average market price per share for the year ended December 31, 2019) for the 
           same total proceeds is the number of shares issued for no consideration. The resulting number of 
           shares issued for no consideration is included in the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
           within the denominator for calculating diluted earnings per share. For the years ended December 
           31, 2019 and 2018, the details are within the table below.

31, 2018: US$30,881,000). These relate mainly to a number of customers for whom there is no history of 
default. The ageing analysis of these past due but not impaired receivables is as follows:

The provision for impairment of receivables includes estimates and assessments of individual receivables 
based on the expected credit loss method. 
 
The Group applies the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 
9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the 
expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and 
the days past due. The expected credit losses below incorporate forward looking information. 
 
Trade receivables of US$1,721,000 were impaired as at December 31, 2019 on which provisions were 
made (December 31, 2018: US$1,653,000). These individually impaired receivables are relatively long 
overdue. 
 
Movement on the provision for the impairment of trade receivables is as follows: 
 
                                                                                   For the year ended

11.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 
      (a)   On January 7, 2020, the Company paid the remaining balance of US$60,000,000 of two of its USD 
            denominated term loans. The Company recognised a loss of US$747,000 related to the repayment. 
 
      (b)   As set out in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company&apos;s China revenue, 
            including both revenue derived from local OEM customers as well as export revenue, totalled 
            US$569.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Due to the evolving developments and 
            impacts associated with the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the Company&apos;s manufacturing facilities 
            in China experienced a staggered restart to component production following the Lunar New Year 
            holiday governed by local government restrictions and requirements. While the Company&apos;s China 
            manufacturing operations have been able to meet customer production requirements, customer 
            demand has significantly contracted to date adversely impacting OEM production. 
 
            Furthermore, the COVID-19 outbreak has also impacted the Company&apos;s global suppliers as well as 
            suppliers who operate in China. These suppliers are relied upon for export of components used in 
            the manufacturing of products provided to customers served by our North America, EMEASA and 
            Asia Pacific segments. Working diligently with both customers and suppliers, the Company has 
            been able to meet the production demand of its global OEM customers to date. 
 
            On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic 
            as the virus has continued to expand throughout Asia, Europe and North America, with many 
            countries and jurisdictions declaring states of emergency and implementing public safety actions 
            in an attempt to contain further spread. The Company has taken commensurate actions outlined 
            by both health agencies, as well as complying with country specific mandates. During the course 
            of March 2020, many of the Company&apos;s OEM customers announced plans to temporarily close 
            their production facilities in Europe and North America. As a result, the Company is coordinating 
            closely with each of its impacted customers and has closed or adjusted production at its facilities in 
            the United States, Mexico, Poland and elsewhere as necessary. Given these customer actions, the 
            Company&apos;s first half 2020 financial results are expected to be significantly lower compared with 
            same period in 2019, however, the Company is unable to quantify the total financial impact of the 
            on-going global pandemic at this time.

HK Bourse: Results Announcement From Nexteer Automotive Group Ltd. -8-</headline>
<text>
<pre>
 
 
 
            Given the rapidly developing worldwide situation regarding COVID-19 and its potential impacts on 
            the economies of afflicted regions, and the inherent difficulty in predicting the potential impact on 
            the Company&apos;s facilities, employees, customers, suppliers and logistics providers, the Company is 
            unable to quantify any further potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at this time. 
 
      (c)   All of the Company&apos;s United States hourly production employees are subject to a collective 
            bargaining agreement (Union or Agreement) that was scheduled to expire on March 21, 2020. The 
            Company and the Union have extended the current Agreement until June 20, 2020 so negotiations 
            can continue. While the Company and the Union continue to work towards a mutually beneficial 
            new Agreement, there can be no assurances that negotiations with the Union will be resolved 
            favourably or that the Company will not experience a work stoppage or disruption that could 
            adversely affect the Company&apos;s operating results and financial condition.

FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Financial Summary 
 
The Group faced a number of macro-environmental headwinds during 2019 which challenged 
the financial performance of the business when compared with last year. The Group&apos;s revenue 
declined by 8.6% during 2019 compared with the prior year, with all three geographic 
segments adversely impacted by slowing original equipment manufacturer (OEM) light 
vehicle production and other customer specific factors. Lower global OEM light vehicle 
unit production across all served regions and unfavourable foreign currency translation were 
significant factors impacting the Company&apos;s revenue comparisons. The Company&apos;s North 
America segment was further challenged during the course of 2019 by an on-going customer 
vehicle platform transition impacting revenue derived by the Company&apos;s CIS product line, and 
the unfavourable impact from the GM - United Automobile Workers (UAW) hourly employee 
strike which temporarily halted vehicle production of the Group&apos;s largest customer in the third 
and fourth quarter of 2019. 
 
The Group&apos;s continued focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction efforts only 
partially mitigated the impact of lower revenue, resulting in a decrease in net profit 
attributable to equity holders of 38.8% during 2019 compared with a year ago. The Company&apos;s 
2018 net profit attributable to equity holders included a US$27.1 million non-recurring US tax 
benefit associated with the company-specific US research tax credit initiatives and represented 
almost 18.4% of the US$147.3 million unfavourable comparison with 2019. 
 
While the operating environment in 2019 proved to be challenging, the Company continued to 
execute its strategy for profitable growth including, but not limited to: 
 
    During 2019, the Group successfully launched a record 45 new customer programmes - 
     13 programmes in North America, 4 programmes in EMEASA and 28 programmes in Asia 
     Pacific. 
 
    The Company secured US$7.0 billion in customer programme awards during 2019, of 
     which 50% reflected conquest business. Furthermore, the Company successfully retained 
     100 percent of incumbent business which was subject to competitive contest in 2019. 
 
    The Group&apos;s Backlog of Booked Business, which includes the value of awarded business 
     for as yet, undelivered product generating revenue between the time of launch through 
     the end of the life of the respective award, increased to US$26.4 billion at the end of 
     2019, an increase of 4.4% when compared with last year. 
 
Operating Environment 
 
The global automotive market has a direct impact on our business and operating results. 
Factors affecting the industry include macro-economic influences such as consumer 
confidence, fluctuations in commodity prices, currency, fuel prices and regulatory 
environments. The Company operates primarily in the US, Mexico, China, Poland, India, 
Morocco and Brazil. 
 
 
 
                                            - 20 - 
Global OEM light vehicle production fell in 2019 when compared with 2018 as a result of a 
slowing global economy and the effect of trade frictions between the US and several foreign 
countries, most notably China. According to IHS Markit Ltd. (January 2020), global OEM 
light vehicle production for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 5.8% compared 
with 2018. North America light vehicle production for the year ended December 31, 2019 fell 
by 3.9% compared with 2018, with North America full-size truck production 3.3% lower. Asia 
Pacific light vehicle production fell by 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared 
 
with 2018, led by the second conservative year of lower China light vehicle production of 8.5%. 
Light vehicle production in EMEASA decreased 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 
compared to 2018. 
 
The Company continues to expand its global operating footprint to service its broad and 
growing customer base and, accordingly, the financial results of the business are impacted 
by changes in foreign currencies measured against the US dollar, principally the European 
euro (Euro) and Chinese renminbi (RMB). The Group&apos;s financial results were unfavourably 
impacted by foreign currency translation as during the course of 2019 the US dollar 
strengthened against both the Euro and RMB compared with a year ago. 
 
Raw material costs represent a significant portion of the Company&apos;s cost of goods sold and 
changes in commodity costs have an impact on the financial results of the business in any 
given period. The Company strives to procure raw materials in the region of consumption and 
sale of products to its customers to minimise supply chain logistics as well as impacts from 
changes in foreign currencies and other factors. Commencing in 2018 and continuing through 
2019, the US imposed various tariffs on goods imported from several foreign countries, with 
tariffs on China imports being the most extensive. While the purchase of commodities used in 
the US manufacturing of the Company&apos;s products are largely sourced from US suppliers, tariff 
regimes imposed between the US and China negatively impacted the Company&apos;s 2019 profit 
before income tax by US$7.3 million compared to 2018. The Company continues to work 
closely with its supplier base to mitigate the impact of such tariffs. 
 
Revenue 
 
The Group&apos;s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was US$3,575.7 million, a 
decrease of US$336.5 million, or 8.6%, compared with US$3,912.2 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2018. According to IHS Markit Ltd. (January 2020), global OEM production 
volume decreased 5.8% from the year ended December 31, 2018, with year-to-year declines 
experienced in all geographic markets served by the Company. Foreign currency translation 
decreased the Group&apos;s revenue by approximately US$55.9 million, principally impacting the 
Asia Pacific and EMEASA segments given the strengthening of the US dollar against the 
RMB and Euro during 2019 compared with a year ago. 
 
We measure the results of our operations by geographic segment regions. The change in 
revenue is analysed by volume, mix, price and foreign currency translation impact. Volume 
measure changes are driven by the volume of products sold and mix changes are driven by 
the type of products sold. Price measures the impact of changes within the pricing structure of 
each product sold. Foreign currency translation impact is measured by the changes in foreign 
currencies measured against the US dollar.

The change in revenue by geographical segments is primarily due to the following: 
 
       North America segment - Revenue decreased by US$176.5 million, or 6.7%, for the 
        year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Several 
        factors impacted the revenue comparison. First, according to IHS Markit Ltd. (January 
        2020), North America OEM light vehicle and full-size truck production during the year 
        ended December 31, 2019 was lower by 3.9% and 3.3%, respectively, compared with 
        a year ago. North America segment revenue was further challenged by an on-going 
        customer vehicle platform transition impacting the Company&apos;s CIS product line which 
        lowered revenue by US$128.0 million. This vehicle platform transition is now expected

HK Bourse: Results Announcement From Nexteer Automotive Group Ltd. -9-</headline>
<text>
<pre>
 
 
 
        to be completed in the first quarter of 2020. During the third and fourth quarter of 2019, 
        the Company&apos;s largest customer, GM, suffered a temporary production interruption as a 
        result of a 40-day UAW hourly employee strike which negatively impacted revenue by 
        US$121.0 million. These factors were partially mitigated by strong programme demand 
        from other customers during the course of 2019 reflecting the favourable impact of 
        carry-over and new programme launches executed by the North America segment in both 
        2018 and 2019. 
 
       Asia Pacific segment - Revenue decreased by US$138.9 million, or 17.8%, for the year 
        ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Significant 
        factors contributing to the revenue decline included unfavourable foreign currency, lower 
        China OEM light vehicle production demand and customer pricing. The Asia Pacific 
        segment experienced US$26.8 million of unfavourable foreign currency translation as 
        the US dollar strengthened against the RMB during 2019 compared with a year ago. 
        According to IHS Markit Ltd. (January 2020), OEM light vehicle production in Asia 
        Pacific declined by 6.4% in 2019 compared with 2018, led by the second consecutive 
        year of declining China OEM light vehicle production which fell by 8.5%, reflecting a 
        slowing China economy as well as the political and economic uncertainty of on-going 
        trade negotiations with the US. Several key China OEM customers of the Asia Pacific 
        segment experienced higher light vehicle production declines from slowing consumer 
        demand during the year which further contributed to the year-over-year revenue decline. 
 
 
 
 
                                               - 22 - 
     EMEASA segment - Revenue decreased US$21.1 million, or 4.2%, for the year ended 
      December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The principal driver 
      of the revenue comparison was unfavourable foreign currency translation of US$29.1 
      million, reflecting the continued strength of the US dollar against the Euro during the 
      course of 2019 compared with a year ago. Although OEM light vehicle production 
      volume in Europe and South America decreased 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 
      2019 compared with 2018, according to IHS Markit Ltd. (January 2020), favourable 
      volume from carry-over and new programme launches provided an offset to the lower 
      OEM demand environment. 
 
Revenue by Products 
 
The following table sets forth the Group&apos;s revenue by product lines for the years indicated:

The Group experienced a decline in EPS revenue of US$115.7 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2019 compared with 2018, largely reflecting lower OEM production levels 
in key geographic regions, most notably lower demand from key China OEM customers of 
the Company&apos;s Asia Pacific segment, as well as unfavourable foreign currency translation 
and customer pricing. The GM-UAW strike, which impacted the North America geographic 
segment, also contributed to the decline in EPS revenue compared with last year. These factors 
were partially offset by higher volumes from several key North America customers, including 
the current and carry-over impact from customer programme launches. CIS revenue declined 
by US$150.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with a year ago, largely 
reflecting the loss of revenue of US$128.0 million associated with an on-going customer 
vehicle platform transition, as well as the impact of the North America GM-UAW strike. DL 
revenue declined by US$51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with 
 
last year, with both the North America GM-UAW strike and lower Asia Pacific OEM light 
vehicle production being the principal drivers of the decline. The decrease in HPS revenue 
resulted from lower production demand from a key customer as expected given the life-cycle 
maturity of this product line. 
 
 
 
 
                                            - 23 - 
Net Profit Attributable to Equity Holders 
 
The Group&apos;s net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year ended 
December 31, 2019 was US$232.4 million or 6.5% of total revenue, a decrease of US$147.3 
million or 38.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 of US$379.7 million, 
representing 9.7% of total revenue. The decrease was principally attributable to the following 
factors: 
 
    Unfavourable foreign currency translation reflecting a stronger US dollar against both 
     the RMB and Euro. 
 
    Lower OEM light vehicle production across all regions served by the Company, in 
     particular continued weakness in China demand; the loss of revenue from a North 
     America customer vehicle platform transition unfavourably impacting the Company&apos;s 
     CIS product line; and the temporary production interruption resulting from the GM- 
     UAW strike in the third and fourth quarter of 2019 which impacted the Company&apos;s 
     North America segment. 
 
    Unfavourable volume and mix from lower revenue, customer pricing, increased 
     depreciation and amortisation expense related to carry-over and current period new 
     customer programme launches and impairment charges for customer programmes 
     not achieving production expectations were only partially offset by net material and 
     manufacturing efficiencies and selling, general and administrative cost reductions. 
 
    Lower net finance costs driven by on-going debt amortisation and interest income from 
     cash balances. 
 
    Higher income tax expense principally reflecting a US$27.1 million non-recurring 
     US tax benefit associated with the company-specific US research tax credit initiative 
     recognised in 2018. 
 
Cost of Sales 
 
The Group&apos;s cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 was US$3,037.0 million, a 
decrease of US$206.3 million, or 6.4% from US$3,243.3 million for the year ended December 
31, 2018. The Group&apos;s cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily included 
raw material costs of US$2,096.4 million (year ended December 31, 2018: US$2,297.3 
million). 
 
Cost of sales decreased principally as a result of lower raw materials costs given the decline 
in revenue experienced by the Group during 2019 compared with a year ago. Material and 
manufacturing savings, net of inflationary factors, further lowered cost of sales in 2019, yet 
were partially mitigated by higher depreciation and amortisation as discussed below. 
 
Depreciation and amortisation charged to cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 
was US$207.7 million, an increase of US$24.2 million, or 13.2%, from US$183.5 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by an increase 
of US$11.2 million related to increased product development cost amortisation discussed 
further below and an increase of US$7.5 million related to depreciation of right-of-use assets 
resulting from the adoption of IFRS16, Leases. 
 
 
                                            - 24 - 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group also recorded as cost of sales impairment of 
property, plant and equipment in the amount of US$6.5 million related to assets deployed in 
support of certain customer programmes in China with declining volumes. 
 
Amortisation of capitalised product development costs recorded as cost of sales amounted 
to US$92.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing 2.6% of revenue, an 
increase of US$11.2 million, or 13.7% from US$81.4 million or 2.1% of revenue, for the year 
ended December 31, 2018. This increase reflects the impact of customer programmes launched 
into production during both 2018 and 2019. The Company expects amortisation expense of 
capitalised product development costs to continue to increase in future years with the start of 
production of new customer programmes that are currently in development. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group recognised a product development 
intangible asset impairment of US$19.6 million related to declining volumes on specific 
customer programmes and programme suspensions in China. The impairment is recorded 
in the consolidated income statement as cost of sales in the amount US$3.7 million and in 
engineering and product development costs in the amount of US$15.9 million in the Asia 
Pacific (US$6.9 million) and North America (US$12.7 million) segments. The intangible asset

impairment in the North America segment associated with customer programmes in China is 
due to the Company&apos;s US domiciled intellectual property holdings. 
 
Gross Profit 
 
The Group&apos;s gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was US$538.7 million, a 
decrease of US$130.1 million, or 19.5%, from US$668.8 million for the year ended December 
31, 2018. Gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 15.1%, as compared 
to 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The effect of unfavourable foreign currency 
translation, lower OEM light vehicle production and customer specific vehicle platform 
demand, customer pricing, higher depreciation and amortisation and impairment were only 
partially mitigated by material and manufacturing cost efficiencies, net of inflationary factors. 
 
Engineering and Product Development Costs 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group&apos;s engineering and product development 
costs charged to the income statement were US$129.1 million, representing 3.6% of revenue, 
an increase of US$12.7 million, or 10.9%, as compared to US$116.4 million, or 3.0% of 
revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Capitalised interest related to engineering 
development costs totalled US$14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 
US$13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Depreciation and amortisation 
charged to engineering and product development costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 
was US$9.8 million, an increase of US$3.5 million, or 55.0%, from US$6.3 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily related to depreciation recorded on 
right-of-use assets in accordance with the Group&apos;s adoption of IFRS 16, Leases. 
 
 
 
 
                                             - 25 - 
The Group&apos;s aggregate investment in engineering and product development costs is defined as 
the sum of costs charged to the consolidated income statement (excluding impairment charges 
associated with costs capitalised in prior periods) and total costs capitalised as intangible 
assets during the current period which will be amortised in future periods upon launch and 
start of production of related customer programmes. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 
the Group incurred an aggregate investment in engineering and product development costs of 
US$296.3 million, an increase of US$24.3 million, or 8.9%, compared to US$272.0 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by the Company&apos;s continued 
focus on expanding its global technical capabilities and resources to pursue and acquire new 
customer programmes as evidenced by the growth in the Backlog of Booked Business, as 
well as on-going investment in current product portfolio enhancements and ADAS and AD- 
enabling technologies. 
 
Administrative Expenses 
 
The Group&apos;s administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were US$120.1 
million, representing 3.4% of revenue, a decrease of US$3.6 million, or 2.9%, as compared 
to US$123.7 million, or 3.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Continuing 
efficiency efforts and focus on leveraging the Group&apos;s cost base were the principal factors 
contributing to the decrease. Favourable foreign currency translation, lower employee stock 
compensation and long-term incentive expense also provided a benefit to 2019 when compared 
with the prior year. Depreciation and amortisation charged to administrative expenses for the 
year ended December 31, 2019 was US$8.8 million, an increase of US$3.1 million, or 56.2%, 
from US$5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily related 
to depreciation recorded on right-of-use assets in accordance with the Group&apos;s adoption of 
IFRS 16, Leases. 
 
Other Gains, net 
 
Other gains, net represents gains attributable to foreign exchange transactions, losses on 
disposal of property, plant and equipment and other items. Other gains, net for the year 
ended December 31, 2019 were US$1.5 million, a decrease of US$13.3 million compared 
to a gain of US$14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was 
principally attributable to losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment related to 
the restructuring of the Group&apos;s US DL business and a reduction of realised gains on foreign 
currency transactions in 2019 compared with the prior year. 
 
Finance Costs, net 
 
Finance costs, net consist of interest income and expense reduced by interest capitalised 
on qualifying assets and product development. The Group&apos;s net finance costs for the year 
ended December 31, 2019 were US$4.9 million, a decrease of US$4.4 million, or 46.7%, 
as compared to US$9.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the 
impact of the increase in borrowings related to the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, on-going 
 
debt repayment and interest income from cash balances were the largest contributors to the 
reduction in finance costs, net during 2019 compared with the prior year. 
 
 
 
 
                                           - 26 - 
Share of Loss of Joint Ventures, net 
 
Share of loss of joint ventures, net relates to the Company&apos;s investments in CNXMotion LLC 
(CNXMotion), Dongfeng Nexteer Steering Systems (Wuhan) Co., Ltd. (Dongfeng Nexteer) 
and Chongqing Nexteer Steering Systems Co., Ltd. (Chongqing Nexteer). For the year ended 
December 31, 2019, the Group&apos;s share of (loss) income in joint ventures amounted to (US$3.5 
million), (US$1.0 million) and US$0.7 million related to CNXMotion, Dongfeng Nexteer 
and Chongqing Nexteer, respectively (year ended December 31, 2018: (US$2.8 million), 
(US$2.2 million) and US$0.6 million). CNXMotion was formed during the first half of 2017 
and has incurred research and development (R&amp;D) costs focused on integrating lateral and 
longitudinal controls for mixed mode and AD applications. As a R&amp;D entity, CNXMotion 
is not anticipated to generate direct revenue for the foreseeable future, but rather benefit the 
Company from the development and transfer of R&amp;D that may be commercialised and used 
in the manufacture of future products. Dongfeng Nexteer was formed during 2017 and while 
production began during 2019, the joint venture has not yet commenced significant customer 
production to offset the current cost structure and investment as at December 31, 2019. 
Chongqing Nexteer&apos;s profitability during the year ended December 31, 2019 was consistent 
with the prior year. 
 
Income Tax Expense 
 
The Group&apos;s income tax expense was US$29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 
representing 11.1% of the Group&apos;s profit before income tax, an increase of US$3.3 million 
from US$26.0 million, or 6.3% of profit before income tax, for the year ended December 31, 
2018. Adjusting for the US$27.1 million non-recurring benefit recognised in 2018 associated 
with the company-specific US research tax credit initiatives, income tax expense was lower 
in 2019 by US$23.8 million reflecting lower pre-tax operating profit when compared with last 
year. 
 
COVID-19 
 
As set out in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company&apos;s China revenue, 
including both revenue derived from local OEM customers as well as export revenue, totalled 
US$569.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Due to the evolving developments 
and impacts associated with the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the Company&apos;s manufacturing 
facilities in China experienced a staggered restart to component production following the 
Lunar New Year holiday governed by local government restrictions and requirements. While 
the Company&apos;s China manufacturing operations have been able to meet customer production 
requirements, customer demand has significantly contracted to date adversely impacting OEM 
production. According to estimates from IHS Markit Ltd., February 2020 year-to-date OEM 
light vehicle production in China declined by 43% when compared with the same period 
in 2019, and for the first quarter ending March 31, 2020, IHS Markit Ltd. estimates China 
OEM light vehicle production to fall by 37% compared with the same period in 2019. The 
Company currently estimates Asia Pacific segment revenue will be unfavourably impacted by 
up to US$40.0 million to US$45.0 million, or 25% to 28%, for the first quarter of 2020 when 
compared with 2019 as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. 
 
 
 
 
                                            - 27 - 
Furthermore, the COVID-19 outbreak has also impacted the Company&apos;s global suppliers 
as well as suppliers who operate in China. These suppliers are relied upon for export of 
components used in the manufacturing of products provided to customers served by our North 
America, EMEASA and Asia Pacific segments. Working diligently with both customers and 
suppliers, the Company has been able to meet the production demand of its global OEM 
customers to date. 
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a 
pandemic as the virus has continued to expand throughout Asia, Europe and North America, 
with many countries and jurisdictions declaring states of emergency and implementing public 
safety actions in an attempt to contain further spread. The Company has taken commensurate 
actions outlined by both health agencies, as well as complying with country specific mandates. 
During the course of March 2020, many of the Company&apos;s OEM customers announced plans 
to temporarily close their production facilities in Europe and North America. As a result, 
the Company is coordinating closely with each of its impacted customers and has closed or 
adjusted production at its facilities in the United States, Mexico, Poland and elsewhere as

necessary. Given these customer actions, the Company&apos;s first half 2020 financial results are 
expected to be significantly lower compared with same period in 2019, however, the Company 
is unable to quantify the total financial impact of the on-going global pandemic at this time. 
 
Given the rapidly developing worldwide situation regarding COVID-19 and its potential 
impacts on the economies of afflicted regions, and the inherent difficulty in predicting the 
potential impact on the Company&apos;s facilities, employees, customers, suppliers and logistics 
providers, the Company is unable to quantify any further potential impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic at this time. 
 
Provisions 
 
As at December 31, 2019, the Group had provisions for restructuring, litigation, environmental 
liabilities, warranties and decommissioning of US$84.1 million, a decrease of US$5.0 million 
as compared to US$89.1 million as at December 31, 2018. The decrease in provisions was 
principally due to the net change in warranty reserves reflecting US$11.3 million in cash 
payments on historical warranty provisions during 2019. Additionally, the Company has 
continued its efforts and focus on improving product quality and manufacturing traceability 
and, as a result of these initiatives, the reversal of historical warranty provisions due to lower 
customer warranty settlements and future claims estimates partially offset new warranty 
provisions recorded during 2019. 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
Cash Flows 
 
Our business requires a significant amount of working capital, which is primarily used 
to finance the purchase of raw materials, capital spending for customer programmes and 
engineering and product development costs. We have historically met our working capital and 
other capital requirements principally from cash generated from operations and borrowings 
from third-party financial institutions. We utilise a combination of strategies, including 
intercompany dividends, intercompany loan structures and other distributions and advances 
to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. The Company utilises a 
 
                                             - 28 - 
global cash pooling arrangement to consolidate and manage our global cash balances, which 
improves cash management efficiency. In recent years, the Group has invested extensively 
in capital equipment and engineering and product development costs in support of customer 
programmes. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group invested US$200.6 million 
and US$167.7 million in capital equipment and capitalised engineering product development 
costs, respectively. 
 
The Group&apos;s use of cash for the year ended December 31, 2019 was directly related to its 
investment in capital and engineering and product development to support future growth. We 
believe that funds generated from operations and cash on hand will be adequate to fund our 
liquidity and capital requirements. 
 
The following table sets forth a consolidated statement of cash flows for the Group for the 
years indicated:

Cash Flows Generated from Operating Activities 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group&apos;s net cash generated from operating 
activities was US$491.2 million, a decrease of US$122.0 million compared with US$613.2 
million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash flows from operating 
activities was primarily attributable to lower net profit and the timing of collection of 
customer trade receivables, partially offset by a decrease in net cash taxes paid as a result of a 
significant income tax receivable as at December 31, 2018, which was collected during 2019. 
 
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
 
 
The Group&apos;s cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect capital spending for 
purchases of machinery, equipment and tooling and capitalised engineering and product 
development costs as intangible assets to support customer programmes.

Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group&apos;s net cash used in financing activities was 
US$184.2 million, a decrease of US$28.1 million compared to US$212.3 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2018. The main contributor to the decrease in net cash used in financing 
activities was lower net repayments of borrowings during 2019 as the Company repaid in 
full the outstanding balance of a US term loan in 2018. Lower net repayments of borrowings 
were partially offset by an increase in dividends paid during 2019 as a result of increased net 
profits for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. In 2019, cash flows used 
in financing activities were mainly comprised of net repayment of borrowings of US$82.3 
million, finance costs paid of US$26.6 million, dividends paid to shareholders of the Company 
of US$77.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from exercise of share options of US$2.5 
million. 
 
Indebtedness 
 
As at December 31, 2019, the Group&apos;s total borrowings was US$369.3 million, a decrease of 
US$12.5 million from US$381.8 million as at December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily 
due to the repayment of maturing debt, partially offset by the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, 
which required the Group to record lease liabilities for certain leases with terms extending

Pledge of Assets 
 
The Group has secured borrowings at certain subsidiaries. Assets securing the borrowings 
differ by site and include accounts receivable, inventories, property, plant and equipment. As 
at December 31, 2019, the Group had total assets pledged as collateral of US$491.3 million, 
an increase of US$62.6 million as compared with US$428.7 million as at December 31, 
2018. The increase in collateral pledged is directly related to increases in the balances of the 
underlying assets pledged. No significant changes in collateral arrangements have occurred 
from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. 
 
Exposure to Currency Rate Fluctuations and Related Hedges 
 
The Group seeks to limit its foreign currency exposure through matching its purchase of 
materials and sale of finished goods in the same currencies subject to sourcing constraints. 
The Group monitors its remaining foreign currency exposure regularly to reduce the risk of 
foreign currency fluctuations in its operations. 
 
 
 
 
                                            - 31 - 
Gearing Ratio 
 
The Group monitors capital structure on the basis of the gearing ratio. The gearing ratio is 
calculated as total borrowings divided by total equity at the end of the respective year. 
 
The gearing ratio as at December 31, 2019 was 19.9%, a decrease of 240 basis points as 
compared to 22.3% as at December 31, 2018. The gearing ratio decreased as a result of the 
paydowns on existing borrowings partially offset by an increase in lease liabilities due to the 
adoption of IFRS 16, Leases. 
 
OTHER INFORMATION 
 
Future Prospects 
 
The Group strives to maintain leadership in global advanced steering and driveline 
systems, ADAS and AD technologies. We boost our prospects by leveraging five Nexteer 
differentiators in a competitive landscape: 
 
1.   Relentless innovation 
 
2.   Depth and breadth of our product portfolio 
 
3.   Systems integration experience 
 
4.   In-house ownership and R&amp;D, design testing and manufacturing 
 
5.   Global manufacturing footprint and prowess 
 
Our global footprint continues to enable our capitalisation of the market transition to EPS and 
continued growth prospects in China and other emerging markets. In addition to strengthening 
and expanding our current business and customer relationships, we are positioned to capitalise 
on the &quot;next conversion wave&quot; to ADAS and AD-enabling technologies such as Steer-by- 
Wire. The Company&apos;s strong financial position also provides the opportunity to pursue 
selected strategic alliances and/or acquisitions to expand our technical capabilities and 
resources, product portfolio and geographic market and customer access. 
 
Backlog of Booked Business 
 
We begin to realise revenue under a new business contract as steering systems and DL 
products are first shipped to vehicle manufacturers at the time of product launch. Product 
launches have historically lagged the date of contract award by an average period of 24 to 
30 months. We have calculated a booked business backlog value which includes the value 
of awarded business for as yet, undelivered product generating revenue between the time of 
launch through the end of the life of the respective award. We estimate the value of all booked 
business under contracts that have been awarded, but for which we have undelivered products 
(the Backlog of Booked Business, Booked Business Amount, Booked Business or Backlog), 
increased by 4.4% to approximately US$26.4 billion as at December 31, 2019 compared with 
US$25.2 billion as at December 31, 2018. 
 
 
                                            - 32 - 
The value of Booked Business is not a measure defined by IFRS, and our methodology for 
determining the Backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies 
in determining the value of their booked business. Assumptions relative to estimated lifetime 
 
programme volumes and contract performance remain unchanged from our disclosures in prior 
periods. Any modification, suspension or cancellation of the contracts related to the Booked 
Business by the Group&apos;s customers may have a substantial and immediate effect on the value 
of the Backlog. While we believe that our current Backlog is a relevant financial metric, we 
must emphasise that the information set out in this section in relation to the Backlog shall not 
constitute any forecast or prediction of the revenue and profits of the Group and the actual 
future value may differ from the estimated Backlog due to various factors beyond the Group&apos;s 
control.

Employees and Remuneration Policy 
 
As at December 31, 2019, the Group had approximately 12,800 full-time employees. The 
Group&apos;s remuneration policies are formulated based on the performance of individual 
employees and the Company&apos;s performance and are reviewed regularly. Our full-time 
employees participate in various employee benefit plans including retirement benefits, 
extended disability benefits and workers&apos; compensation. In addition, we have adopted 
employee incentive plans designed to attract, retain, motivate and encourage employees to 
commit to enhancing value for us and our shareholders as a whole. For example, the Group 
has retention programmes that include individual development plans, merit wage adjustments, 
annual incentive plans and promotions. We offer training programmes to our full-time 
employees and contract personnel which are designed to develop the skills that we need to 
meet our enterprise goals and customer requirements and to meet certain training requirements 
such as mandated customer or regulatory requirements and contractual obligations. 
 
The Group also uses contract personnel to support the workload of the business where 
considered the most efficient. As at December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,000 
personnel engaged on a contract basis.

HK Bourse: Results Announcement From Nexteer Automotive Group Ltd. -13-</headline>
<text>
<pre>
 
 
 
The Company periodically reviews its corporate governance practices with reference to the 
latest developments of the Hong Kong CG Code. 
 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
 
Under the Code Provision A.2.1 of the Hong Kong CG Code, the roles of chairman and CEO 
should be separate and should not be performed by the same individual. During the period 
from January 1, 2019 to June 2, 2019, Mr. ZHAO Guibin was the Chairman of the Board 
and the CEO of the Company. The Board believed that this structure would not impair the 
balance of power and authority between the Board and the management of the Company or 
the Group, given that: (i) decisions made by our Board require approval by at least majority 
of our Directors and we believe there are sufficient checks and balances in the board; (ii) Mr. 
ZHAO and the other Directors are aware of and undertake to fulfil their fiduciary duties as 
Directors, which require, among other things, that each Director, including Mr. ZHAO, acts 
for the benefit and in the best interests of the Group and will make decisions for our Group 
accordingly; and (iii) the balance of power and authority is ensured by the operations of the 
Board which is comprised of experienced and high calibre individuals who meet regularly to 
discuss issues affecting the operations of the Group. Moreover, the overall strategic, financial 
and operational policies of the Group are made collectively after thorough discussion at both 
the Board and senior management levels. 
 
In the context of substantive change to and fierce competition in the global automotive 
industry, to achieve the Company&apos;s vision of &quot;A Leader in Intuitive Motion Control&quot;, the 
Company&apos;s CEO, Mr. ZHAO Guibin, needed to focus on the Company&apos;s strategy and its 
execution and ceased to serve as the Chairman of the Board with effect from June 3, 2019 and 
was appointed as Vice Chairman. The Board had approved the appointment of Mr. WANG 
Jian, a non-Executive Director of the Company, as the Chairman of the Board in place of 
Mr. ZHAO Guibin with effect from June 3, 2019. Upon such appointment, the Company has 
complied with the Code Provision A.2.1 of the Hong Kong CG Code. 
 
 
 
                                            - 35 - 
COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF CONDUCT REGARDING DIRECTORS&apos; 
SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS 
 
The Company has adopted the Model Code for Securities Transactions by Directors of Listed 
Issuers (the Model Code) as set out in Appendix 10 to the Listing Rules as the Company&apos;s 
code of conduct regarding securities transactions by the Directors of the Company. Having 
made specific enquiry of all Directors, all Directors have confirmed that they complied with 
the required standards set out in the Model Code for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
 
The Company has also adopted its own code of conduct regarding employees&apos; securities 
transactions in terms no less exacting than the standard set out in the Model Code for the 
compliance by its relevant employees who are likely to be in possession of unpublished inside 
information of the Company in respect of their dealings in the Company&apos;s securities. 
 
The Company maintains and regularly reviews a sensitivity list identifying factors or 
developments which are likely to give rise to the emergence of inside information or 
development of a false market for its securities. 
 
The Company ensures that confidentiality agreements are signed by all relevant parties to a 
transaction that is likely to give rise to the emergence of inside information or development of 
a false market for its securities. The Company also adopts appropriate measures to maintain 
the confidentiality of the information, such as using project codes and restricting access to 
such information to a limited group of recipients on a need-to-know basis. 
 
The Company organises periodic training as it deems necessary for employees who, because 
of their office or employment, are likely to be in possession of inside information in relation 
to the Company, to help them understand the Company&apos;s policies and procedures as well as 
their relevant disclosure duties and obligations.

Huazhu Group Near-Term Earnings Likely Weighed by Coronavirus -- Market Talk</headline>
<text>
<p>
     0316 GMT - Huazhu Group&apos;s near-term earnings may be pressured by the coronavirus pandemic, Citi Research says, cutting its target price to $30 from $40 and downgrading it to neutral from buy. Although the hotel operator could benefit from a gradual recovery in its China operations, its European operations may be disrupted by the spreading coronavirus amid rising uncertainties, Citi says. Huazhu&apos;s expansion plans in China may also be affected, as companies are more cautious on hotel openings given the pressures on operating cash flow, the U.S. bank says. Shares were last down 7.1% at $27.77. (justina.lee@wsj.com) </p>

FBI, SEC Looking Into Lawmakers&apos; Stock Trades After Coronavirus Briefings: Report -- MarketWatch</headline>
<text>
<p>
  The FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into stock trades by lawmakers made before the market plunged due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, CNN reported Sunday night (https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/29/politics/justice-stock-trades-lawmakers-coronavirus/index.html). Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., is among those who have been asked about his trades, CNN reported. Burr and Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., have been harshly criticized after reports emerged that they allegedly sold stocks (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/two-senators-are-under-fire-for-selling-stock-before-the-coronavirus-market-crash-but-do-insider-trading-laws-apply-2020-03-20) following briefings on Capitol Hill which included non-public information about the outbreak. CNN said the probe is in its early stages and it is unclear if any laws were broken. In a statement to CNN, one of Burr&apos;s lawyers said the senator &quot;welcomes a thorough review of the facts in this matter, which will establish that his actions were appropriate.&quot; </p>
