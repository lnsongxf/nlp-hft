ICUs Leverage Remote Doctors and Telemedicine to Manage Coronavirus Deluge</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Christopher Mims | Photographs by Ryan Lowry for The Wall Street Journal </pre>
<p>
     As American cities face a surge of coronavirus patients who will require lifesaving care, they are also facing a rapidly dwindling supply of available intensive-care-unit beds. Physicians and nurses at many of the country&apos;s largest hospital systems are leveraging a decades-old technology in new ways -- at times coupling it with cheap, readily available gadgets -- to expand their ability to care for and monitor patients. </p>
<p>
     Generally known as &quot;tele-ICU,&quot; this two-way bedside video is sort of like FaceTime or Zoom. The difference is that it typically adds a host of other technologies to videoconferencing, in order to connect critically ill patients in hospital ICU beds with teams of doctors and nurses who specialize in delivering care to the sickest, even when those teams are miles or even whole states away. </p>
<p>
     The technologies include high-definition cameras with pan, tilt and zoom abilities, so they can home in on anything in the hospital room, from the patient&apos;s face to the instruments at bedside. They also include direct connections to equipment like heart-rate and blood-pressure monitors. These traditionally expensive systems can connect remote specialists to the doctors and nurses at patients&apos; bedsides, often at smaller hospitals and in rural locations. </p>
<p>
     But to treat waves of patients struggling with Covid-19, doctors and technicians are also appropriating less expensive remote-monitoring tech to their arsenal of existing tele-ICU systems. It&apos;s the difference between spending tens of thousands of dollars a bed on top-of-the-line tech that could take weeks to be delivered and installed, and switching to systems that include commercial tablets and can be installed at patients&apos; bedsides immediately. </p>
<p>
     If things get really bad, medical providers could enlist the help of store-bought tablets and laptops, as they have in hurricanes and other past disasters. </p>
<p>
     In the sheer number of patients needing intensive care, coronavirus presents a trial far beyond any that such technology has been put through before. The result is an example of rapid innovation -- even disruption -- in action, as professionals are forced to improvise using only the gear at hand. By their own accounts, beyond finding it merely serviceable, they are developing and sharing new methods in real time. It&apos;s a medical hackathon in which lives are at stake and the papers analyzing what worked best may have to wait until after the catastrophe has passed. </p>
<p>
     As in other disasters or even wartime, the results show what&apos;s possible when people are asked to do the impossible and are freed to use any means necessary to accomplish it. It may be a taste of the medical innovation to come, as the entire world is forced to find ways to grapple with an accelerating pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The health professionals at Northwell Health, which includes 23 hospitals and 72,000 employees across New York state, are rapidly increasing the number of tele-ICU beds from 170 to 420, and say they could accommodate far more. (New York state has desperately tried to add to its 3,000 ICU beds; Gov. Andrew Cuomo has warned it might need 40,000.) </p>
<p>
     Swedish hospital system in Seattle, another coronavirus hot spot, is leveraging a variety of telehealth technologies, partly to keep health-care workers from being exposed to coronavirus and to keep patients at home when possible. </p>
<p>
     But of all of the programs to address shortages of health-care providers at Swedish, &quot;I think the tele-ICU capacity is the most important one at this time,&quot; says Elizabeth Meade, the medical director of pediatric quality and safety at Swedish. </p>
<p>
     The point of tele-ICU isn&apos;t to replace staff on premise, but to supplement them while also keeping the scarce supply of trained intensivists physically removed from patients to minimize their risks of infection. Doctors on the other side of the screens at patients&apos; bedsides can help with monitoring and can even use local staff as their &quot;hands&quot; when they need to manipulate something in the room. </p>
<p>
     Four hospitals in Atlanta&apos;s Emory Healthcare system are using tele-ICU technology to support staff. One example is easing the burden of monitoring stable patients when on-premise staff must intubate a Covid-19 patient, a procedure that requires extra people and effort due to the risk of infection, says Timothy Buchman, medical director of Emory&apos;s electronic ICU service. </p>
<p>
     &quot;In situations where requirements and demands are changing rapidly, the ability to move from one room to the next, or one hospital to the next, literally at the speed of light, allows us to make the most efficient allocation of what are increasingly scarce human resources,&quot; Dr. Buchman says. </p>
<p>
     Northwell has a telehealth command center in Syosset, N.Y., from which teams of critical-care physicians and nurses are already monitoring more than 130 beds, of which 116 are occupied by Covid-19 patients, says Kara Benneche, director of clinical operations of telehealth services at Northwell. </p>
<p>
     Physicians and nurses at Northwell&apos;s Syosset center sit at banks of six to eight monitors, connected to two-way video-conferencing systems that allow them to see and interact with patients and any health professionals in the patients&apos; rooms. The most elaborate of the bedside systems, produced by Philips under the trade name eCareManager, also gives doctors a live feed of a patient&apos;s vital signs. </p>
<p>
     &quot;That&apos;s the beauty of tele-ICU: One person sitting in a tele-ICU center can take care of 50 to 100 beds,&quot; says Saurabh Chandra, medical director of telehealth services at Northwell. Advanced tele-ICU systems make the monitoring of such numbers possible because they include software that alerts physicians when patients&apos; vital signs cross into dangerous territory, he adds. </p>
<p>
     But these devices, part of elaborate, expensive service packages for whole hospitals, can take time to install even under normal conditions. Facing a flood of new patients and obstacles to setting up new equipment, Northwell doctors are getting creative with tech they already have on hand. In December, Northwell ordered a batch of 35 movable carts with two-way video conferencing capability from American Well, which are scheduled to arrive in early April. </p>
<p>
     These carts were intended to be used in any department in any of Northwell&apos;s hospitals and other facilities. But many are being pressed into service in a variety of roles necessitated by the pandemic, including connecting to ICU beds. Physicians can access the carts&apos; cameras remotely from a computer. Carts are being sent wherever they&apos;re needed, across Northwell&apos;s hospital system, and can be wheeled from room to room. </p>
<p>
     This system can also save doctors and nurses who are on site from having to enter patients&apos; rooms, says Ms. Benneche. Remote practitioners using these systems can&apos;t do anything in patients&apos; rooms that requires their hands -- such as adjusting an IV or a ventilator. But they can check patients&apos; overall condition, and use the system&apos;s cameras to zoom in on bedside monitoring equipment, allowing them to check vital signs just as they would if they were in the room. Every time they do this, it saves them 10 to 15 minutes of suiting up in protective gear, she adds. </p>
<p>
     One challenge for the coronavirus patients is the isolation, with loved ones not allowed in. But while tele-ICU can also mean less human contact, nurses are on the other hand more readily available in at least one way: Patients who are able can touch a button at any time to talk to them, something they do frequently just to cope with loneliness, says Ms. Benneche. </p>
<p>
     SOC Telemed, which provides telemedicine technology to more than 600 hospitals across the U.S., will add 100 hospitals to its platforms in the next 45 days on account of the pandemic, says Jason Hallock, the company&apos;s chief medical officer. About one in seven ICU beds in the U.S. already have tele-ICU capability, he adds. </p>
<p>
     In 2018, SOC Telemed equipped Onslow Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville, N.C., with telemedicine capabilities, including tele-ICU, in just 18 hours when flooding from Hurricane Michael cut off the hospital from outside help. Using a telemedicine cart Onslow staff already had on hand, &quot;we took care of anyone from a newborn baby to someone in their late 90s, &quot; says Dr. Hallock. </p>
<p>
     Tele-ICU is only one part of what must be a much broader response to the coronavirus pandemic, emphasizes Eric Toner, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and author of a report on the ultimate impact of coronavirus on the U.S. &quot;I think [tele-ICU and related] strategies can improve our capacity to have trained people provide care, but I think they&apos;re limited,&quot; he adds. </p>
<p>
     One thing tele-ICU cannot do is remove existing barriers to which doctors can pitch in at any given hospital, notes Dr. Hallock. It can take 120 days for a physician to become authorized to work at a hospital. While &quot;emergency privileges&quot; can speed this process, for now the technology of allowing remote care is running far ahead of the system&apos;s ability to absorb physicians who could consult through it. Another issue is that states traditionally do not allow doctors to practice medicine without a license specific to that state, limiting the ability of out-of-state doctors to help. These aren&apos;t insuperable barriers -- Emory Healthcare previously set up a tele-ICU facility in Australia so health professionals there could cover the night shift at Emory&apos;s ICU units in the U.S. -- but they take time to overcome. </p>
<p>
     Martin Doerfler, a Northwell senior vice president in charge of telemedicine, says he is preparing his hospitals both for the initial peak of the virus, as well as what could be an even bigger peak come November, should coronavirus become seasonal like the common flu. </p>

ICUs Leverage Remote Doctors and Telemedicine to -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     If it comes to that, teams of doctors at Northwell might have to connect to any tablet or mobile device through a web app, from their central tele-ICU center and remote centers it has set up at each of its hospitals. This option would be limited, lacking the pan and zoom capabilities of dedicated cameras, while offering only basic two-way communication between a remote physician and a patient or bedside nurse. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I&apos;m practicing now for hundreds -- or thousands -- of cases and hopefully not tens of thousands,&quot; says Dr. Doerfler. </p>

Marriage With Family at Its Center</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By W. Bradford Wilcox </pre>
<p>
     On March 13 -- the day my wife informed me that our weekend date night was off because our governor had declared a state of emergency -- I had an inkling that big changes were in store for our marriage. A few days later, as we found ourselves barely managing to home-school six children, work two jobs and run a big household on lockdown, I knew that the loss of a regular date night was going to be the least of our marital challenges. Scenarios like ours -- and ones much, much harder, with millions of parents losing jobs, heading to the front lines to battle the virus or grieving the loss of loved ones -- are playing out in homes across America. </p>
<p>
     There is no doubt that the fallout of this pandemic will exact a toll on marriage in America. The marriage rate will fall, as fewer men and women have the confidence to head to the altar amid the greatest recession in our lifetime -- much as the marriage rate fell in the wake of the Great Recession. </p>
<p>
     For those who are already married, the stresses and strains of marriage and family life in the time of Covid-19 will send thousands of couples to divorce court. Marital failure will be especially common for husbands and wives under the sway of what I call the &quot;soul mate model&quot; of marriage. The soul mate model -- trumpeted in books like Elizabeth Gilbert&apos;s &quot;Eat, Pray, Love,&quot; not to mention countless songs and rom-coms -- is the idea that marriage is primarily about an intense emotional and romantic connection between two people and should last only so long as that connection remains happy and fulfilling for both parties. This self-centered model gained in popularity for many Americans starting in the 1970s, the &quot;Me Decade.&quot; </p>
<p>
     But feelings are a fragile foundation for marriage. A recent YouGov survey indicates that married people in California who hold this view of marriage are about 60% more likely to think their marriage might end in divorce, compared with those who have a more family-first model of marriage, believing that &quot;Marriage is about romance but also the kids, money, raising a family together.&quot; No doubt the disappearance of date nights and so much more in today&apos;s trying times will undo many marriages founded on the idea that marriage is supposed to make you feel good all the time. </p>
<p>
     The silver lining here is that -- in the face of so much trauma and economic dislocation -- most marriages will not collapse, and many will instead emerge stronger and more stable as husbands and wives develop a new appreciation for how much they love and depend on their spouse -- and how much they, their kids and their kin depend on them keeping their marriage together. As I wrote a decade ago about the Great Recession, the hardship &quot;led many Americans to deepen their commitment to marriage and, in some cases, to table or cancel their plans to divorce or separate.&quot; In fact, the divorce rate dropped in the immediate wake of that economic downturn and has fallen more than 20% over the last decade. The divorce rate is likely to fall even faster in the wake of this new crisis. </p>
<p>
     That&apos;s because in times of trial and tribulation, most people -- and most spouses -- don&apos;t become more self-centered, they become more other-centered, more cognizant of how much they need their family members to navigate difficult and dark times. In post-Covid-19 America, I&apos;m confident that the family-first model of marriage will gain ground against the soul mate model. </p>
<p>
     As for me and my bride, we didn&apos;t enjoy a date night last weekend, but I was able to deliver food, some socially distanced conversation and air hugs from the grandchildren to my homebound 70-something in-laws. And it felt better than date night. </p>

Virus Pushes Trump to Rose Garden Campaign Strategy</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Gerald F. Seib </pre>
<p>
     Sometimes presidents choose to adopt a Rose Garden strategy to campaign for re-election, opting to make their case with the White House as a dramatic backdrop. </p>
<p>
     President Trump has adopted such a strategy because of the coronavirus, and he worked this week to make the most of it. Meanwhile, his real campaign is chugging along in virtual form below the radar screen. </p>
<p>
     Technically, Mr. Trump is using a pressroom strategy, because the White House briefing room rather than the Rose Garden just beyond its doors has become his forum for staying in front of voters. He now makes almost daily appearances there for a late-afternoon briefing and jousting session with White House reporters. </p>
<p>
     Other officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and government health experts, are on hand, too, but Mr. Trump is the clear star of the show. On Monday, his appearance stretched for almost two hours. </p>
<p>
     That has caused TV networks to debate whether to continue airing the briefings live. Meantime, the president stirred controversy this week by using that setting to argue for reopening the country&apos;s businesses sooner rather than later, sparking a backlash from experts who fear such a move is simply too risky. </p>
<p>
     Still, in political terms, the approach appears to be paying dividends. Mr. Trump&apos;s job-approval rating has ticked up in a series of polls. In the rolling Gallup survey, his weekly average has moved into positive territory with 49% approving of his performance while 45% disapprove. </p>
<p>
     Meantime, his campaign says it is utilizing digital tools to reach voters while much of the nation is shuttered. Between them, the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign say they have 550,000 trained volunteers. Last Saturday, the campaign says, supporters made 1.5 million calls from their homes to other voters, urging them to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for virus guidance -- while also touting Mr. Trump&apos;s record and urging supporters to register to vote online if they can. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Trump Campaign has a significant advantage because of our early and ongoing investment in data and technological infrastructure,&quot; asserts Ken Farnaso, deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign. </p>
<p>
     Former Vice President Joe Biden is reacting in kind, however. The presumptive Democratic nominee has geared up his own version of a Rose Garden strategy by setting up a mini TV studio in his Delaware home, from which he has delivered an online speech, held a conference call with reporters and conducted televised interviews. </p>

A New Frontier for Medical Technology</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Amy Compton-Phillips </pre>
<p>
     Around 8 p.m. on Jan. 20, I received the call: A test had confirmed that one of the hospitals where I oversee clinical care, in Everett, Wash., had admitted the first Covid-19 patient in the U.S. The coronavirus bomb went off in our corner of the country that day, and we quickly realized that the pandemic would change health care faster than anything before. We are now leveraging telehealth technology in ways that will last long after this pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The Providence health system, where I work, now has more than 1,200 beds occupied by patients who have the virus or are suspected of having it across the seven states in the western U.S. where we operate. We&apos;re now testing more than 11,000 people a day and are running four clinical trials. </p>
<p>
     Within several weeks we were sharing lessons we had learned, from the importance of planning and data to treating all patients suspected of infection as though they already had it. We shared remote technology with colleagues, such as an online AI tool to help patients determine for themselves, from home, the level of care they need and how to get it. </p>
<p>
     The severity and suddenness of the Covid-19 emergency have hastened changes to how we deliver care. Red tape that initially hamstrung the Food and Drug Administration has been removed to speed the development of testing and treatments. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued waivers that allow cross-state licensing of medical professionals and reimbursement for telehealth measures. We&apos;ve been trying to accomplish some of these things for years, and they all happened in the last six weeks. </p>
<p>
     Long before Covid-19, our team had created a strategic plan called &quot;Clinical Care 2030&quot; to use technology to provide personalized, affordable care by the end of this decade. Those priorities are suddenly on the fast track. We&apos;re using technology today in ways that any public or private health system can do, in the current emergency and in the future. </p>
<p>
     To increase intensive care capacity, our teleICU command centers remotely monitor ICU rooms and direct care as needed. A nurse at a command center in Montana can monitor ICU patients in a Washington hospital and alert a physician to a change in a patient&apos;s status, just as if they were located in the same building. </p>
<p>
     For staffing shortages, our &quot;telehospitalist&quot; program lets hospitals bring in more physicians in a hurry. We have more than 10,000 doctors enrolled to help manage patients remotely, which can provide expert care in an area experiencing a surge of patients without needing to physically move the physicians. </p>
<p>
     So far, most patients don&apos;t need to be hospitalized, and treating people at home lets us reserve our limited acute care resources for those with severe symptoms. Our telehealth service is keeping a virtual eye on patients showing signs of possible Covid-19 via a pulse oximeter (a simple oxygen sensor placed on the finger) and a digital thermometer. If symptoms worsen, we quickly arrange additional care. We have monitored over 500 patients so far and have the capacity for 4,000, with more in the works. </p>
<p>
     Covid-19 has created a global crisis, but it has also fueled a sudden leap toward the future of medicine. Across the country, we are driving changes that will bring better health care to everyone once this nightmare finally ends. </p>
<p>
     --Dr. Compton-Phillips is the chief clinical officer of Providence, a Catholic not-for-profit health system with 51 hospitals. </p>

The Cure for Panic Attacks -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  The dangers lurking in the market can be hidden or delayed, but never eliminated. For investors, slumps are a chance for introspection--and, sometimes, new opportunity. </p>
<pre>
By Jason Zweig </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     How could a microscopic organism destroy nearly $15 trillion in global stock-market wealth in five weeks? </p>
<p>
     Until recently, many investors believed central banks and other policy makers had repealed the business cycle and that making money in the stock market was something you could take for granted -- in much the same way that science and technology seemed to have beaten back diseases that had been the scourge of humanity for millennia. </p>
<p>
     Maybe investors a century ago and more had a wiser view. They believed the world was governed by unseen, omnipresent powers that could be appeased but never controlled -- and that financial panics were a form of divine retribution for the sinful excesses of prosperity. </p>
<p>
     We shouldn&apos;t regard market panics as quaint artifacts from the days of ticker tape and trading by telephone. Rather, they are forces that can be hidden or delayed but never eliminated. And believing that panics have become obsolete is a precondition for their recurrence. </p>
<p>
     The modern history of financial markets is a chronicle of attempts to control risk -- if not eliminate it. One after another, they have all failed. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We trust these brilliant innovators in finance who seem to know what they&apos;re doing when they try to control risk,&quot; says Yale University economist and financial historian William Goetzmann. &quot;And then, lo and behold, the risk mitigation doesn&apos;t happen.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Federal Reserve was created in the wake of the Panic of 1907 to mitigate the risk of financial meltdowns. </p>
<p>
     Some thought the problem could be solved. As the stockbroker DeCourcy W. Thom proclaimed in his postscript to economist Clement Juglar&apos;s &quot;A Brief History of Panics&quot; in 1916: &quot;Just as modern medicine is overcoming the dangers threatening the physical man, so is modern finance overcoming panic and the other dangers which threaten financial stability.&quot; </p>
<p>
     He was wrong -- as similar forecasts have been ever since. </p>
<p>
     The Fed failed to stave off the crash of 1929 and, by not expanding the money supply in the early 1930s, probably worsened the Great Depression. </p>
<p>
     In the mid-1980s, a computerized hedging technique called &quot;portfolio insurance&quot; purported to limit losses for big institutional investors; it ended up being partially blamed for the crash of 1987. </p>
<p>
     In the mid-2000s, financial engineers created ever-more-complex derivatives as a way of carving up and spreading risk. That, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in 2005, &quot; contributed to the stability of the banking system&quot; by allowing participants &quot;to measure and manage their credit risks more effectively.&quot; </p>
<p>
     But risk can&apos;t be removed; it can only be moved. The techniques hailed by Mr. Greenspan may have caused the financial crisis of 2008-09 by making bankers and investors so complacent that they never sufficiently tested whether their assumptions might be wrong. </p>
<p>
     Finally, in the run up to the latest panic, many investors seemed to believe index funds and exchange-traded funds, which can offer broad diversification at extremely low cost, had somehow eliminated the risk of owning stocks. </p>
<p>
     Our forebears, on the other hand, believed panics are the indispensable hygiene of markets, sweeping the investing landscape clean after every orgy of prosperity. </p>
<p>
     That notion was captured brilliantly by the illustrator Frank Bellew in a cartoon for New York&apos;s &quot;The Daily Graphic,&quot; days after the onset of a market panic in 1873. An ugly giant straddles the street, sweeping up clouds of dirt and shreds of ticker tape labeled &quot;BOGUS BROKERS,&quot; &quot;SHAKY BANKS&quot; and &quot;ROTTEN RAILWAYS.&quot; He wears tattered goatskins, his hair tangling into horns as it rises from his scalp. </p>
<p>
     The caption reads: &quot;Panic, as a Health Officer, Sweeping the Garbage out of Wall Street.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Bellew personifies Panic as the god Pan, who haunted the countryside of ancient Greece. Half-goat, moody and mischievous, Pan was the god of herds, manipulating them with the music from his pipes. He lurked in mountain caves, arising at midday to burst out of nowhere at startled travelers. </p>
<p>
     No wonder the ancient Greeks called a sudden fear &quot;panikos.&quot; It came from Pan. </p>
<p>
     He was also the god of fertility. And financial panics, through the ensuing upheaval, fertilize old ground for new competitors and transfer assets to those who can put them to their best use. </p>
<p>
     Out of the boom and bust in wooden turnpikes in early 19th-century New England came the rights of way that railroads later followed with ease through the forests and fields. Out of the mania for technology stocks that collapsed in 2000-02 came the glut of fiber-optic networks that make instant communication universal and cheap as dirt today. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. and British economies &quot;cannot subsist without sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind of a financial crisis two or three times in each generation,&quot; wrote the financial journalist Horace White in 1876. Financial crises, said White, recurred with &quot;the regularity of clock-work, so that people pretend to know when to expect one by looking in the almanac.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The early U.S. suffered severe financial panics roughly once every 13 years on average, in 1792, 1819, 1826, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1884, 1893 and 1907. </p>
<p>
     People used to regard booms and busts as part of &quot;an organic cycle of life,&quot; not as outcomes that can be prevented or controlled, says Mr. Goetzmann of Yale. </p>
<p>
     In that organic cycle, entrepreneurs who think business conditions will improve &quot;become centers of infection, and start an epidemic of optimism, &quot; the economist Wesley Clair Mitchell wrote in his 1913 book, &quot; Business Cycles.&quot; That optimism leads to a &quot;flood tide of prosperity,&quot; which washes away caution, creating euphoria that culminates in a crash -- which, in turn, clears the way for recovery. Lather, rinse, repeat. </p>
<p>
     In recent decades, psychologists have shown that people tend to overweight recent experience in their predictions of the financial future. Because markets rise more often than they fall, the experience of most investors tends to be positive over time. The longer the good times roll, the more remote the chance of a decline will seem, the more overconfident investors will feel and the more risk they will take. </p>
<p>
     Only lately has that euphoria not seemed sinful. </p>
<p>
     An early panic on the Amsterdam stock exchange was a natural consequence of the preceding bull market, when caution was &quot;called foolishness, madness and crime,&quot; wrote the pamphleteer Joseph Penso de la Vega in 1688. &quot;The spirit of Ahab and Satan&quot; had enticed speculators to join in the &quot;jubilation&quot; of soaring prices. </p>
<p>
     Investors were frantic in 1720 as shares in the South Sea Co. soared and then crashed in London. Only God could restore them to sanity, Jonathan Swift wrote the next year in his poem &quot; Upon the South-Sea Project&quot;: </p>
<p>
     &quot;May he, whom Nature&apos;s Laws obey, </p>
<p>
     Who lifts the Poor, and sinks the Proud, </p>
<p>
     Quiet the raging of the Sea, </p>
<p>
     And still the Madness of the Crowd.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Investors in ages past didn&apos;t believe that the stock market was efficient. They thought it was -- and always would be -- a whirlwind of emotion. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Wall Street is as much the natural field for panics as the prairie is for tornadoes,&quot; said the financier John Ferguson Hume in his 1888 book &quot; The Art of Investing.&quot; </p>
<p>
     People then understood what we have forgotten: When you look into a bubble, what you should see in that mirrored surface is yourself. </p>
<p>
     After all, it isn&apos;t investments that make or lose money; it is investors, with our own excesses of greed and fear. And that means market panics aren&apos;t a time for reaction; they are a time for introspection. </p>
<p>
     So ask yourself: Have I been taking more risk than I realize? Conversely, how should I turn panic into opportunity? How can I improve my portfolio and restore a sense of control? Should I sell some stocks or funds to generate a tax loss I can use to offset gains or income? Do I have long-held mediocre or risky stock positions I&apos;ve been reluctant to dump until now because that would have generated a taxable gain I&apos;d no longer incur at today&apos;s prices? </p>
<p>
     Blind faith in tools for controlling financial risk has never made sense. If risk could ever be eliminated, investors would immediately turn so euphoric that they would drive the prices of financial assets sky-high -- thereby creating an enormous new risk out of the absence of all the old ones. </p>
<p>
     Investors should never stop trying to manage their risks. But they should never believe that they, or anyone else, can eliminate them. </p>

Dow Ends Week Up, Despite Friday Fall -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Karen Langley, Avantika Chilkoti and Chong Koh Ping </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its biggest weekly gain since 1938, paring some of the losses of recent weeks, as lawmakers agreed to the largest economic-relief package in U.S. history in response to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Investors have been on a roller-coaster ride as attempts to curb the coronavirus pandemic constrain economic activity and policy makers work to cushion the blow. Major U.S. stock indexes posted double-digit gains for the week -- with the Dow surging 13% and the S&amp;P 500 climbing 10% -- but remain down more than 20% in 2020. </p>
<p>
     After a furious three-day rally earlier in the week, stocks pulled back Friday. The blue-chip index fell 915.39 points, or 4.1%, to 21636.78. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 3.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 3.8%. </p>
<p>
     Investors looking for government spending measures to soften the economic damage watched throughout the week as legislators agreed to and passed a $2 trillion stimulus package. The legislation, which President Trump signed Friday, is the largest economic-relief package in U.S. history and would extend aid to many Americans through direct payments and expanded unemployment insurance. A record 3.28 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, nearly five times the previous record high. </p>
<p>
     Earlier in the week, the Federal Reserve signaled a wide-ranging effort to help the U.S. economy by extending loans and purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars in government debt. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The one-two punch is important,&quot; said Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer for Morgan Stanley. &quot;What the market is saying is earnings are going to be really bad in the near term, economic growth is going to be really bad in the near term, but with this kind of a stimulus I can see that a recovery will happen at some point later this year potentially.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Despite the week&apos;s gains for stocks, there were signs that investors remain cautious. Gold, a traditional haven, posted its largest one-week percentage gain since September 2008. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury fell for a second consecutive week, dropping 0.188 percentage points to 0.744%. </p>
<p>
     The Cboe Volatility Index, a closely watched measure of turbulence in U.S. stocks, finished the week lower after rising for five consecutive weeks, its longest such streak since December 2012. Many investors expect the recent market volatility to persist. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think this will continue for some time,&quot; said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. &quot;The news is going to be spotty and investors have been scrambling.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The U.S. overtook China this week as the country with the most coronavirus cases. As of Friday, the U.S. had more than 97,000 confirmed cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Hospitals in the New York metro area and Seattle have been overwhelmed despite stringent measures to curtail the contagion. </p>
<p>
     Adding to concerns about how long the pandemic may damp economic activity, China said Thursday it would close its borders to nearly all foreigners and drastically slash international flights in a bid to curb the reintroduction of the virus from abroad. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Underlying all this is how do we get this virus under control,&quot; said Neil Hennessy, chief investment officer of Hennessy Funds. &quot;Once we have it under control or it peaks, subsides, whatever, then the market will be back on its legs.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Investors and business leaders remain concerned that emergency measures by the Federal Reserve and U.S. lawmakers, including the stimulus package, may not prevent a sharp U.S. recession that could have global consequences. </p>
<p>
     &quot;What we&apos;re trying to do is put the economy on ice and sow the seeds of a strong rebound as soon as the crisis is over, recouping as much economic ground as possible,&quot; said Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank. &quot;It&apos;s a volatile environment where we will, within that context, see repeated bold policy responses, but they are pushing on an open door.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Oil prices declined after the U.S. Department of Energy suspended the purchase of 30 million barrels of crude oil it was going to add to its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The meeting of G-20 leaders also disappointed some traders after it failed to produce any statement that related to oil or the price war raging between Saudi Arabia and Russia. U.S. crude declined for a fifth consecutive week, losing 4.9% for the week to $21.51 a barrel. </p>
<p>
     Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 6.1% for the week, snapping a five-week losing streak. Japan&apos;s Nikkei 225 climbed 17% for the week. </p>

Bailout Aids Boeing Even If It Doesn&apos;t Tap Funds -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Andrew Tangel and Doug Cameron </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Boeing Co. is set to emerge as a big winner of the coronavirus stimulus package, even if the aerospace giant declines to seek direct taxpayer help. </p>
<p>
     The company had lobbied for at least $60 billion for itself and its vast supplier network to blunt the blow of the pandemic that has paralyzed global airline travel and reduced demand for passenger aircraft. </p>
<p>
     The prospect of canceled orders and airlines unable to take new planes added to the pressure on Boeing from the continuing crisis around the grounding since last year of its 737 MAX jets, which has already sent its debt soaring as it borrowed to compensate customers and support suppliers. </p>
<p>
     The $2 trillion stimulus bill approved by Congress includes much of what it wanted: billions of dollars available for it and its supply chain, and billions more to its struggling airline customers to stay in business. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s important that the supply chain gets relief,&quot; said Eric Fanning, chief executive of the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group that counts Boeing among its members. &quot;The most effective way to inject support is through its customers.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Whether Boeing will tap into stimulus money directly remains to be seen. </p>
<p>
     Lawmakers set aside $17 billion in loans and loan guarantees directed at companies deemed essential to national security. Congressional officials and a senior U.S. aviation industry executive said the carve-out was partly aimed at Boeing. </p>
<p>
     Tapping that $17 billion pot would come with strings that Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun has rejected. In particular, the loans would come with a condition that the U.S. government take an equity stake or warrants for shares in loan recipients. The government could instead take a senior debt position in recipients. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Right now, Boeing is saying they don&apos;t need it,&quot; U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday on Fox Business Network. He added: &quot;I appreciate the fact that Boeing thinks they can operate on their own -- that&apos;s what we want them to do.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Earlier this week, Mr. Calhoun told the television network Boeing would rather secure private financing than give the government an equity stake. &quot;If they forced it, we&apos;d just look at all the other options, and we have got plenty,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Calhoun said this week that Boeing had $15 billion in cash, and it still has access to a $9.6 billion loan facility. </p>
<p>
     A Boeing spokesman said Friday the company was considering all options for government aid, including a share of $454 billion of stimulus funds available to businesses across industries that don&apos;t require the government taking an equity stake. </p>
<p>
     U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen (D., Wash.), whose district includes Boeing&apos;s Seattle-area operations, said the plane maker had lobbied against the equity-stake requirement, but lawmakers wanted to protect taxpayers. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If Boeing does take advantage of the program, it does help the workers and supplier network quite a bit,&quot; said Mr. Larsen, who heads a key House aviation panel. </p>
<p>
     Boeing shares, which had doubled this week, dropped 7% on Friday. Shares in its suppliers and U.S. airlines also fell sharply. The declines reverse gains earlier this week following the Senate&apos;s passage of its stimulus plan. </p>
<p>
     Whatever help Boeing might wind up seeking, President Trump has vowed to protect the Chicago-based manufacturer. It is widely regarded as too important to the nation&apos;s economy and national defense for the government to allow it to fail. Boeing is the nation&apos;s largest exporter and second-largest defense contractor. It supports thousands of smaller businesses that supply everything from aircraft fuselages and wings to cockpit electronics. </p>
<p>
     The company has declined to detail the components of the $60 billion it has been seeking. After the Senate passed its stimulus bill late Wednesday, Boeing praised the package, saying its liquidity boost was &quot;critical for airlines, airports, suppliers, and manufacturers to bridge to recovery.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Faced with mounting financial strain, Boeing has suspended its dividend and has been considering potential layoffs. Executives have said they were working to avoid cutting or furloughing employees from its 65,000-worker commercial arm. </p>
<p>
     Under the proposed stimulus plan, certain loan recipients must maintain at least 90% of their current workforce through Sept. 30, among other worker protections, eliciting praise from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents Boeing factory workers in the Seattle area. </p>

Heard on the Street: How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love the Bear Market -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Spencer Jakab </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Everyone thinks they&apos;re a genius in a bull market, but it&apos;s only when prices head south that some people really stand out from the crowd. </p>
<p>
     As odd as it sounds, the average investor is woefully below average. Compared to a robot who might invest through good and bad, ignoring newspaper headlines, a fallible human can end up with a lot less money on retirement day due to greed and fear. Knowing how to handle fearful times like these offer the best opportunity to avoid lagging behind the market. </p>
<p>
     Sure, some investors will claim they saw the coronavirus-induced bear market coming, just like there are people who say they sold ahead of the housing bubble or the dot-com crash. Maybe some of them are even telling the truth. But there were plenty of excuses to take profits over the past decade during what became the longest bull market in history -- the trade war, the European debt crisis and ludicrous unicorn valuations, to name just a few. Up until a month ago, acting on them would have cost you. </p>
<p>
     Trying to pick the bottom of a bear market is even more hazardous to your wealth. Being what seems like a long way from the top doesn&apos;t mean you aren&apos;t still just as far from the bottom: A market that has lost half of its value is one that lost a jarring 30% and then another 30% after that. </p>
<p>
     Investor psychology in a major bear market is a mirror image of what it was the past few years: The more false alarms there were on the way up, the likelier investors were to embrace risk, viewing dips as buying opportunities. On the way down, so-called suckers&apos; rallies -- and the technical bull market we reached on Thursday may well have been one -- get our hopes up and then crush them. By the time a really prolonged bear market is about to end, investors who haven&apos;t sold in disgust probably have a lower percentage of their net worth in stocks than at the outset. That is one of the costliest mistakes investors make. </p>
<p>
     A surprising share of a new bull market&apos;s returns pile up in its very early stages when people are most fearful. Take the one that ended last month. Putting $100,000 into an S&amp;P 500 index fund on the day the bull began on March 9, 2009 and selling at last month&apos;s peak would have seen that turn into $630,000 including dividends. Waiting just three months to make sure it wasn&apos;t yet another head fake would have earned you only $450,000. </p>
<p>
     If you wait for happy headlines or hopeful government statistics for a clue for when to pounce, you&apos;ll be too late. Stocks typically rally before a recession is over. For example, imagine an investor who went back over the last eight recessions, all the way back to the Great Depression, and bought the S&amp;P 500 or its predecessor index at the bottom of the accompanying bear market, only to sell as soon as the recession officially ended. This market-timing genius would have made an annualized return of over 64%. That compares to a long-run annualized return for U.S. stocks of about 9.7%. </p>
<p>
     You also can&apos;t rely on unofficial information like whether your neighbors are still unemployed. Joblessness is headed much higher soon, which is poisonous for profits and consumer sentiment, but the situation will likely be bad and still getting worse when the market turns. Looking back at 14 spikes in unemployment going back to the 1930s, one could have bought stocks three months before the rate peaked and earned a respectable gain every single time. </p>
<p>
     Making lemonade out of the market&apos;s lemons sounds tempting, but it isn&apos;t easy. The old saw goes that the stock market is the only one where people run away when there&apos;s a sale. Beforehand they crowd in when the wares are most expensive because they see everyone else getting rich. For example, in the 10 months leading up to the last market peak in October 2007, a net $84 billion flowed into equity mutual funds according to the Investment Company Institute. By contrast, a net $233 billion flowed out from June 2008 through March 2009, the heart of the bear market when stocks became screaming bargains. </p>
<p>
     Are they bargains now? Not really. One of the more reliable measures of how expensive stocks are, the cyclically-adjusted price to earnings ratio popularized by Yale University professor Robert Shiller, put the S&amp;P 500 at 23.8 times earnings on Friday. That is more expensive than average and compares to 13.3 times when the last bull market began. </p>
<p>
     If you believe that the damage the Covid-19 pandemic does to the global economy will be on par with the financial crisis and plan to wait until stock valuations reflect that view, it may be awhile. To fetch a similar valuation, stocks might have to drop another 40% or more from here, leaving the Dow Jones Industrial Average well below 15000. </p>
<p>
     But every downturn is different. A valuation measure like the Shiller P/E makes for a lousy timing tool. If you were content having, say, 70% of your savings in stocks last month when the Dow industrials were on the cusp of 30000 and the Shiller P/E at 32 then you should be at least as comfortable at 20000. That means buying more stocks and selling bonds as markets fall and repeating that all the way down. </p>
<p>
     If the last month truly convinced you that you had too much money in stocks to sleep well at night then take your lumps and dial back your risk permanently. But if you&apos;re merely waiting for a sign that it&apos;s safe to buy again then just hold your nose, increase your allocation to equities, and learn to love bear markets. </p>

     For Enrique Lores, the seat has been on fire since he took HP Inc.&apos;s top job in November. An electrical engineer who joined the company as an intern in 1989, the 54-year-old Spaniard was barely in charge when turmoil started. </p>
<p>
     Four days after his start date, news broke that Xerox Holdings Corp. was cobbling together an offer to buy the 81-year old computer-hardware maker. In the months that followed, Mr. Lores swatted away hostile salvos from Xerox. In a letter sent to shareholders Wednesday, he wrote that pursuing a megadeal during a pandemic isn&apos;t prudent. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The key thing I need to do right now is prioritize my time,&quot; Mr. Lores told me Thursday morning during a Zoom chat. HP manufactures and sells gadgets in markets all over the world, many of which have been rattled by the coronavirus outbreak. If Mr. Lores doesn&apos;t keep production lines moving, management teams talking, and customers buying during a crisis, there will be no HP left for Xerox or anyone else to pursue. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Right now is when we show the value and culture of HP,&quot; he said. The hardware giant is known for its printers, desktop computers and laptops; Mr. Lores thinks now is the time to write a &quot;new chapter.&quot; Two things he wants the company to be more associated with are 3-D printers and any product that helps America work from home. </p>
<p>
     Like many CEOs I&apos;ve talked to this month, Mr. Lores is spending way more time in his northern California home office than ever before, using the tiny portal on a smartphone or webcam to talk with people he used to grab in hallways or informally congregate with in a conference room. He regularly checks in on operations in hard-hit nations, including Italy and China, and is monitoring liquidity like a hawk. </p>
<p>
     The tone of conversations is changing. &quot;I think what we&apos;re seeing broadly is people opening themselves up.&quot; He&apos;s sat through a lot of stories recently, including during his calls with those who keep HP&apos;s coffers full. &quot;We not only talk about the business, but we use the time to engage with our customers on a different level.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Lores is the latest in a line of people whose jobs I&apos;ve profiled during these unprecedented times for the Journal&apos;s special &quot;Making it Work&quot; series. </p>
<p>
     I&apos;ve learned how a funeral home director advises mourners how to say goodbye in an era of social distancing. How a mail carrier spends as much time washing his hands as delivering mail. How a nurse figured out a sanitary way to reuse a disposable gown. </p>
<p>
     The CEO&apos;s role in making it work? Point people to the light at the end of the tunnel. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Lores took the HP job with an eye on transforming a culture in need of a refresh. He began his 31-year HP career on a team developing a graphics printer called the DraftMaster. He went on to run various company units, including imaging and printing. He was instrumental in the split of the Hewlett-Packard Co. in 2015, which separated the personal computing division from the division selling corporate services and hardware. </p>
<p>
     Four weeks before officially taking over for his predecessor, Mr. Lores started shaking things up. He announced up to 9,000 job cuts and said services and new technologies, such as HP&apos;s nascent 3D-printing unit, needed to be a higher priority going forward. </p>
<p>
     Crafting this new strategy and battling Xerox&apos;s takeover attempt consumed a substantial amount of time at the start of the year when HP&apos;s management began hearing about coronavirus. Mr. Lores tapped heads of four different HP units to monitor the situation and build a continuity plan while the rest of the company focused on growth, cost cutting and strategy. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The world has radically changed in these last two or three weeks,&quot; Mr. Lores said. </p>
<p>
     HP&apos;s capital strategy shows how quickly things can change. In late February, Mr. Lores announced a $15 billion share buyback plan designed to stave off Xerox. That included $8 billion in repurchases committed within a year. That seems like a pipe dream today. </p>
<p>
     A month later, Mr. Lores is spending time evaluating the scale of that plan. The economy has nosedived; HP&apos;s stock -- like almost every Blue Chip in America -- has tanked; and credit availability is fragile. &quot;Right now, cash is king,&quot; he said Wednesday. </p>
<p>
     Rather than fast-track new guidance to appease Wall Street, Mr. Lores is preaching prudence. &quot;We need to say the right thing at the right time.&quot; Spending all his time with finance executives and the treasury staff to address one issue would limit his effectiveness. </p>
<p>
     Because casual encounters can&apos;t happen in virtual workplaces, Mr. Lores has bumped up his meetings with senior executives from one a week to three, and is calling on three or four major customers a day. He has changed the digital background on the Zoom app to the Palo Alto, Calif., garage where Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard started the company. </p>
<p>
     There are people who Mr. Lores regularly checks in with: Two of his sons have returned from New York to California during the self-isolation era; his predecessor at HP, Dion Weisler; HP&apos;s Chairman Chip Bergh (who is CEO of Levi Strauss &amp; Co.). And he regularly talks to his sister and brother in Spain, where both are doctors. </p>
<p>
     He also meets regularly with a group of CEOs in similar industries. An avid runner, Mr. Lores tries to squeeze in running or cycling time. When not on conference calls or reviewing company estimates, forecasts and plans, he pores over emails from employees. </p>
<p>
     Workers share stories and express eagerness to pitch in any way they can. &quot;The problem is not to find people who want to participate, it&apos;s trying to choose the people we want to do it.&quot; He wants the workforce to pace itself. &quot;We need to realize this is not going to be a very short-term thing.&quot; </p>
<p>
     On Wednesday, Mr. Lores hosted a video Q&amp;A with 1,200 company leaders. His message to them is that while HP is weathering the same storm every other company is, it has unique opportunities. The trick is to find them, analyze them, and seize them. </p>
<p>
     Many of the startups disrupting older, established companies did exactly that during the financial crisis. Companies such as Airbnb Inc. and Spotify Technology SA were created during or immediately after the last major downturn. Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and other tech companies, meanwhile, experienced exponential growth then, following years of tinkering with unprofitable business models. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Lores has told his employees to use this current crisis to reinvent HP. </p>
<p>
     The most immediate initiative that shows they are listening directly relates to combating the pandemic. HP has ramped up its printing of mask adjusters, face shields, and hands-free door openers on 3-D medical printers, and has already supplied more than 5,000 of these products to hospitals. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s not only about protecting ourselves,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s about finding opportunity.&quot; </p>

Cloud Industry Scores Big Win -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Aaron Tilley </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Cloud-computing providers are emerging as among the few corporate winners in the coronavirus pandemic as office and store closures across the U.S. have pushed more activity online. </p>
<p>
     The remote data storage and processing services provided by Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Google and others have become the essential link for many people to remain connected with work and families, or just to unwind. </p>
<p>
     The hardware and software infrastructure those tech giants and others provide, commonly referred to as the cloud, underpins the operation of businesses that have become particularly popular during the virus outbreak, such as workplace-collaboration software provider Slack Technologies Inc., streaming video service company Netflix Inc. and online videogame maker Epic Games Inc. </p>
<p>
     Demand has been so strong that Microsoft has told some customers its Azure cloud is running up against limits in parts of Australia. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Due to increased usage of Azure, some regions have limited capacity,&quot; the software giant said, adding it had, in some instances, placed restrictions on new cloud-based resources, according to a customer notice seen by The Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>
     A Microsoft spokesman said the company was &quot;actively monitoring performance and usage trends&quot; to support customers and growth demands. &quot;At the same time,&quot; he said, &quot;these are unprecedented times and we&apos;re also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;If we think of the cloud as utility, it&apos;s hard to imagine any other public utility that could sustain a 50% increase in utilization -- whether that&apos;s electric or water or sewage system -- and not fall over,&quot; Matthew Prince, chief executive of cloud-services provider Cloudflare Inc. said in an interview. &quot;The fact that the cloud is holding up as well as it has is one of the real bright spots of this crisis.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The migration to the cloud has been happening for about a decade as companies have opted to forgo costly investments into in-house IT infrastructure and instead rent processing hardware and software from the likes of Amazon or Microsoft, paying as they go for storage and data processing features. The trends have made cloud-computing one of the most contested battlefields among business IT providers. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you look at Amazon or Azure and how much infrastructure usage increased over the past two weeks, it would probably blow your mind how much capacity they&apos;ve had to spin up to keep the world operating,&quot; said Dave McJannet, HashiCorp Inc., which provides tools for both cloud and traditional servers. &quot;Moments like this accelerate the move to the cloud.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In a message to rally employees, Andy Jassy, head of the Amazon&apos;s Amazon Web Services cloud division, urged them to &quot;think about all of the AWS customers carrying extra load right now because of all of the people at home.&quot; </p>
<p>
     An Amazon spokesman declined to discuss use rates of it service, but said &quot;we have taken measures to prepare and we are confident we will be able to meet customer demands for capacity in response to COVID-19.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Brad Schick, chief executive of Seattle-based Skytap Inc., which works with companies to move existing IT systems to the cloud, has seen a 20% jump in use of its services in the past month. &quot;A lot of the growth is driven by increased usage of the cloud to deal with the coronavirus.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For many companies, one of the attractions of cloud services is they can quickly rent more processing horsepower and storage when it is needed, but can scale back during less busy periods. That flexibility also is helping drive cloud-uptake during the coronavirus outbreak, said Nikesh Parekh, CEO and cofounder of Seattle-based Suplari Inc., which helps companies manage their spending with outside vendors such as cloud services. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are starting to see CFOs worry about their cash positions and looking for ways to reduce spending in a world where revenue is going to decline dramatically over the next quarter or two,&quot; he said. &quot;That will accelerate the move from traditional suppliers to the cloud.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Even cloud-service providers, though, are expected to feel the impact from the wider downturn in global growth. Many of them serve companies such as airlines and hotel operators that have been hit hard by the outbreak and have been cutting costs, which could include slashing spending on cloud services in coming weeks and months, said Corey Quinn, a cloud-computing economist at the Duckbill Group, a firm that helps customers lower their Amazon cloud bills. </p>
<p>
     Still, some startups selling software tools that run on the major cloud platforms are seeing a noticeable increase in interest in their products. Qumulo Inc., which sells software to help users manage the data they store across different cloud-providers, saw a surge in demand as customers sent employees to work from home in recent weeks, its CEO, Bill Richter, said. </p>
<p>
     Qumulo, he said, offers a similar file-management system to handle data on in-house servers but, amid the health crisis, 90% of new and existing customers are asking for the cloud version -- traditionally, it was more of an even split. Some of the biggest users, he said, are media and entertainment-services providers that shifted to remote working while still having to edit large files stored in the cloud. </p>

Who Is and Isn&apos;t Covered Under Paid-Leave Act -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Charity L. Scott </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     With new rules expanding paid sick and family leave going into effect April 1, small businesses across the country are scrambling to figure out which parts of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act apply to them and how to comply. Here are answers to many of the questions employers and employees are asking, and a few questions that remain unanswered: </p>
<p>
     What types of paid leave must be provided by employers covered by the new law? </p>
<p>
     Employees that can&apos;t work because they have symptoms associated with Covid-19 or are under quarantine must receive two weeks or up to 80 hours of paid sick leave at their full rate or the applicable minimum wage, if higher. </p>
<p>
     If an employee is caring for a quarantined person or a child who can&apos;t go to school or day care because of the pandemic, the employer must provide two weeks or up to 80 hours paid leave at two-thirds of the employee&apos;s normal rate. </p>
<p>
     Employees who have been employed at least 30 days can also take up to 10 additional weeks of paid family and medical leave at two-thirds their normal rate, to care for children at home due to the outbreak. </p>
<p>
     Workers may be able to take leave intermittently, but only with their employer&apos;s permission, according to fresh guidance issued by the Department of Labor on Thursday. </p>
<p>
     Which employers must comply with the provisions of the new law? </p>
<p>
     Businesses based in the U.S. with fewer than 500 employees are covered by the new paid-leave rules. </p>
<p>
     For companies with separate entities, divisions or subsidiaries, the Department of Labor is using two different tests to determine how employees should be counted. Rebecca Baker, an employment and labor lawyer, said that when counting employees for the expanded family and medical leave, businesses should use the integrated employer test from the existing Family and Medical Leave Act. </p>
<p>
     When counting for the new paid sick time, employers should use the joint employer tests under the Fair Labor Standards Act. &quot;What could end up happening is for purposes of the paid sick time requirements, I might be covered, but for purposes of the expanded FMLA, I may not be covered,&quot; Ms. Baker said. </p>
<p>
     Is this part of the $2 trillion economic rescue package? </p>
<p>
     No, these paid-leave requirements were passed in a separate bill signed into law by President Trump on March 18. They apply whether or not employees or employers receive loans or payments from the federal stimulus package, which is known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. </p>
<p>
     What types of employees should be counted? </p>
<p>
     The law applies to full- and part-time employees, temporary workers (even if they are jointly employed with another business), day laborers and employees who are already on leave. Independent contractors are not employees under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, and shouldn&apos;t be counted. </p>
<p>
     Does the Families First Coronavirus Response Act contain any employer exceptions? </p>
<p>
     Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees can potentially qualify for an exemption. So far, the Department of Labor has said exemptions will be available if the expanded paid leave requirements would threaten the business&apos; viability, but hasn&apos;t yet issued specific guidelines on who qualifies or how to apply. </p>
<p>
     Are there any caps on how much leave covered employers must provide? </p>
<p>
     Yes, but the limits vary depending on the employee&apos;s circumstances. If the employee is under quarantine or experiencing symptoms associated with Covid-19, they must be paid either their full rate or the minimum wage, if it&apos;s higher, up to $511 a day or $5,110 for two weeks. </p>
<p>
     The limits for employees caring for a sick person are $200 a day or $2,000 for two weeks. For workers taking care of a child home from school, the cap is $200 a day and $12,000 total, which includes two weeks of paid sick leave and 10 weeks of the expanded family and medical leave. </p>
<p>
     What will happen to small businesses who aren&apos;t fully compliant on April 1? </p>
<p>
     The Department of Labor said in a memo Tuesday it won&apos;t take enforcement action against employers before April 17, as long as they are making a good-faith effort to comply with the law. </p>
<p>
     How long will these new paid leave provisions be in effect? </p>
<p>
     The requirements of Families First Coronavirus Response Act will apply through Dec. 31 </p>
<p>
     What questions haven&apos;t been answered by the Department of Labor yet? </p>
<p>
     The Department of Labor hasn&apos;t yet said if employees whose workplace closed due to a stay-at-home order issued by a state or local government or who have already been furloughed qualify for leave under the act. </p>
<p>
     The department has also stated qualifying employees include those &quot;experiencing any other substantially-similar condition specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of Labor and Treasury,&quot; but hasn&apos;t yet clarified what that means. </p>

Working From Home During Coronavirus Pandemic Hasn&apos;t Broken Internet -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Sarah Krouse and Lillian Rizzo </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Home internet and wireless connectivity in the U.S. have largely withstood unprecedented demands as more Americans work and learn remotely. </p>
<p>
     Broadband and wireless service providers say traffic has jumped in residential areas at times of the day when families would typically head to offices and schools. Still, that surge in usage hasn&apos;t yet resulted in widespread outages or unusually long service disruptions, industry executives and analysts say. That is because the biggest increases in usage are happening during normally fallow periods. </p>
<p>
     Some service providers have joked that internet usage during the pandemic doesn&apos;t compare to the Super Bowl or season finale of the popular HBO show &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; in terms of strain on their networks, Evan Swarztrauber, senior policy adviser to the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said this week on a call hosted by consulting company Recon Analytics Inc. </p>
<p>
     Broadband consumption during the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. has risen by more than 50% since January, according to broadband data company OpenVault, which measured connections in more than one million homes. Usage during the peak early-evening hours increased 20% as of March 25. </p>
<p>
     OpenVault estimates that average data consumption per household in March will reach nearly 400 gigabytes, a nearly 11% increase over the previous monthly record in January. </p>
<p>
     &quot;What we have seen is a redistribution of where and how the network is used,&quot; said Tami Erwin, head of Verizon Communications Inc.&apos;s business group. </p>
<p>
     While some consumers have complained about grainy video calls or streaming videos and slower download speeds, problems have so far been limited to nuisances, rather than wholesale crashes. </p>
<p>
     Some carriers that use cells on wheels and aerial network-support drones after hurricanes or tornadoes are now deploying those resources to neighborhoods with heavy wireless-service usage and places where health-care facilities need additional connectivity. </p>
<p>
     Several wireless carriers including Verizon, T-Mobile US Inc. and AT&amp;T Inc. have been given temporary access to fresh spectrum over the past week to bolster network capacity. Cellphone networks have so far managed to stay connected in most places, though some customers have complained of busy signals when they try to make a call during work hours. </p>
<p>
     AT&amp;T on Sunday said its overall cellular-data traffic was almost flat as more customers connected to their home Wi-Fi networks. But the volume of mobile voice calls surged as much as 44% over typical levels. </p>
<p>
     Capturing a comprehensive view of the overall health and strength of U.S. connectivity is difficult because there is no centralized source of public data on wireless or home-internet service. Telecommunications and cable companies report outages to the Federal Communications Commission on a confidential basis. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Typically, you have network peaks and valleys. I think you see much more sustained peaks,&quot; said Chet Kanojia, chief executive of internet provider Starry Inc. Daytime usage in markets the company serves like Boston and New York has reached about 85% of peak activity, he said. </p>
<p>
     Some families have begun setting ground rules and establishing a hierarchy for who has priority access to home networks. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have to allocate the bandwidth to the person who is bringing in the money,&quot; said Terrence Barrett, an order manager for a large technology company. He is settling into working from home near St. Louis with his two sons for the foreseeable future and says his eldest son&apos;s gaming has to take a back seat during work hours. </p>
<p>
     The experiment hasn&apos;t been without frustrations. </p>
<p>
     Neelabah Pant, who pays for Charter Communications Inc.&apos;s Spectrum internet and began working from home early last week in Dallas, said he has to restart his modem and router once a day to speed up a sluggish connection. </p>
<p>
     Charter has seen some increased daytime network activity, especially in areas heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic, &quot;but levels remain well below capacity and typical peak evening usage in most markets,&quot; a spokeswoman said. The Stamford, Conn.-based company has been closely monitoring its networks and consulting with other connectivity providers, the spokeswoman added. </p>
<p>
     One reason for gaps between the speeds customers pay for and those that are delivered by internet providers is what is known as the oversubscription structure used by most broadband networks. When broadband providers pipe bandwidth into neighborhoods, it is shared by those households as if not every household is using it at the same exact time. </p>
<p>
     Rana el Kaliouby ran out of bandwidth while recording a podcast from her home, at the same time her daughter took an online driver&apos;s education program and her son played videogames. </p>
<p>
     The next day, she asked them to switch off their activities for an hour while she conducted a virtual presentation to 150 people to promote her coming memoir called &quot;Girl Decoded.&quot; </p>
<p>
     She expects her home network, Comcast Corp.&apos;s Xfinity Blast internet package with download speeds of up to 300 megabits a second, to be even more strained as her children participate in remote learning. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I don&apos;t know how that&apos;s going to work,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Comcast&apos;s networks have held up as peak traffic increased 20%, said Tony Werner, president of technology at Comcast Cable. Currently, the network is running at just above 40% capacity, he said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Werner said the network surrounding Ms. el Kaliouby&apos;s area looked &quot;rock solid&quot; and suspected it to be a Wi-Fi or application issue. </p>
<p>
     Some companies have adapted to the shift without interrupting service. Netflix Vice President Dave Temkin, speaking on a videoconference hosted by the network analytics company Kentik, said his engineers took some upgrades originally planned for the holiday season near the end of 2020 and simply made them sooner. </p>
<p>
     A European regulator earlier this month asked Netflix to shift all its videos to standard-definition to avoid taxing domestic networks. Mr. Temkin said Netflix managed to shave its bandwidth usage using less drastic measures. </p>
<p>
     &quot;None of it is actually melting down,&quot; he said. </p>

Fox Business Parts Ways With Host -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Benjamin Mullin </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Fox Corp.&apos;s business channel said it parted ways with host Trish Regan, who was taken off the air two weeks ago after she dismissed concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as &quot;impeachment all over again.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ms. Regan hosted &quot;Trish Regan Primetime&quot; during Fox Business&apos; 8 p.m. hour until March 13, when her show was put on hiatus due to what Fox Business said were &quot;the demands of the evolving pandemic crisis coverage.&quot; </p>
<p>
     A few days earlier, she had delivered a monologue saying the &quot;liberal media&quot; were using the coronavirus to &quot;destroy&quot; the president and &quot;encourage a market selloff.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is yet another attempt to impeach the president,&quot; Ms. Regan said during her March 9 program. &quot;And sadly, it seems they care very little for any of the destruction they are leaving in their wake. Losses in the stock market -- all this, unfortunately, just part of the political casualties for them.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Days later, Ms. Regan said on her program that health professionals should &quot;test for the virus&quot; to help prevent its spread. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I have enjoyed my time at FOX and now intend to focus on my family during these troubled times,&quot; Ms. Regan said in a statement Friday released by the network. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to this next chapter in my career.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Attempts to reach Ms. Regan directly were unsuccessful. </p>
<p>
     Fox Business also said Friday it was &quot;reducing its primetime coverage&quot; in order to &quot;allocate staff resources to continuous breaking news coverage on the Coronavirus crisis.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Hosts at Fox Business&apos;s sister channel Fox News -- including Sean Hannity, host of Fox News&apos; 9 p.m. &quot;Hannity&quot; show -- have come under fire for minimizing the threat of the coronavirus before urging caution. Mr. Hannity on March 9 said he would &quot;call out anyone and everyone who&apos;s using this virus as a political weapon against the president&quot; and likened concerns about the virus as a &quot;new hoax.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The following week, Mr. Hannity said his program &quot;has always taken the coronavirus seriously.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Tucker Carlson, host of Fox News&apos; 8 p.m. show &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight,&quot; struck a graver tone early on, raising the alarm about the spreading coronavirus in early March during his opening monologue. </p>
<p>
     &quot;People you know will get sick,&quot; Mr. Carlson said. &quot;Some may die. This is real. That&apos;s the point of this script -- to tell you that.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Fox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Regan has been a financial journalist for more than a decade. Before she joined Fox Business in 2015, Ms. Regan anchored &quot;Street Smart,&quot; a daily market-close program for Bloomberg TV. Ms. Regan was also an anchor at CNBC, where she hosted a daily markets show and anchored documentaries. </p>
<p>
     While working as a financial correspondent for &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; in 2007, Ms. Regan earned an Emmy nomination for investigative journalism, according to her Fox Business bio. </p>

Macau Offers Glimpse of Post-Virus Future -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Mike Cherney </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     At casinos in Macau, the world&apos;s biggest gambling hub, customers must wear masks, have their body temperature taken upon entry and refrain from eating or drinking at the gambling tables. </p>
<p>
     The new procedures could be a preview of what U.S. casinos, which have largely shut to stop the spread of the coronavirus, will do if they reopen in the coming weeks and months. Unlike the U.S., Australia and parts of Europe, Macau&apos;s casinos are open, and how the casinos fare could offer clues on how quickly gamblers might return in other markets. </p>
<p>
     So far, the results are grim. Macau&apos;s casinos shut down for about two weeks in February, but the government allowed them to reopen on Feb. 20 with the new procedures. Gross gambling revenues fell nearly 90% in February, and analysts are expecting another steep drop in March, perhaps by as much as 80%. Travel restrictions have prevented most mainland Chinese tourists from visiting the semiautonomous city, contributing to the decline. </p>
<p>
     At U.S. casinos, &quot;we don&apos;t expect one day the lights are going to go on and be exactly as it was,&quot; said Michael Soll, president of The Innovation Group, a consulting firm in the U.S. for the gambling and hospitality industries. &quot;The customer base probably does not return overnight.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The coronavirus is transforming everything from how people work to how they shop for groceries, and it is forcing companies to adjust how they do business. The casino safety procedures are just one example of how businesses are adapting their operations to the unprecedented circumstances created by the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     But even when U.S. casinos reopen, there will be other challenges. They will have to compete with online gambling, which some analysts expect to attract new customers as people are locked down inside their homes. Consumers might still be wary of visiting places with large crowds, or be put off by temperature checks and other new restrictions at the casinos. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We could see similar restrictions at any mass-type gatherings and larger entertainment venues around the world for a period after this,&quot; said Simon Holliday, founder of market data and consulting firm H2 Gambling Capital. &quot;Many of these would be temporary until there is a vaccine, but as with any major event such as this, some will stick in certain markets.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Some U.S. casinos experimented briefly with similar social-distancing measures. Wynn Resorts Ltd. on March 12 said it would screen body temperatures of customers using noninvasive thermal cameras and that additional space would be created between guests at gaming devices and dining tables. Wynn, which also operates casinos in Macau, closed its Las Vegas and Boston casinos just a few days later. </p>
<p>
     In Australia, casinos also implemented new safety measures last week before the government shut them down Monday along with other nonessential businesses. At a casino in Sydney run by Star Entertainment Group Ltd., temporary barriers were placed around different sections of the gambling floor, and employees kept track of how many people entered each area. Every other slot machine was deactivated. </p>
<p>
     At the roulette tables, customer Trent Daniels said employees enforced new rules that only three people could be at each table. &quot;I thought it was prudent,&quot; said Mr. Daniels, 34 years old. </p>
<p>
     How quickly health authorities will allow casinos to reopen in Australia and other markets is another matter. Truly keeping a casino sanitized would involve wiping down slot machines after each customer finished using them, said Simon Chapman, an emeritus professor in public health at the University of Sydney. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There&apos;s an awful lot of touching on the gaming machines,&quot; said Mr. Chapman, one of nearly a dozen academics who signed a letter asking the Australian government to close its casinos sooner than it did. &quot;People are often in there hours at a time.&quot; </p>
<p>
     By last week, Macau&apos;s government said 37 casinos had reopened, with two closed, and that 80% of the city&apos;s table games were back in operation. One casino was closed because the hotel where the casino is located was designated as a quarantine venue, and another was closed because of renovations. </p>
<p>
     Other new measures for Macau&apos;s casinos include prohibiting entry to people who had been in China&apos;s Hubei province, where the coronavirus emerged, over the previous 14 days. Employees and customers are also supposed to complete a personal health declaration from the government, which is available online. </p>
<p>
     Despite reopening the casinos, investment bank Jefferies estimated this week that Macau gambling revenue will decline 48% this year, and still be 12% lower in 2021 than it was in 2019. Jefferies expects Macau to start recovering in the third quarter of this year as travel restrictions are lifted. </p>
<p>
     Others in the industry are wary to even hazard a guess. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There has never been mass casino closures like this in history, and the political, financial, and physical-contact restrictions are in such uncertainty from day to day,&quot; said Bill Friedman, a former Las Vegas casino manager and president of Friedman Management Group. &quot;I have no idea where we are headed.&quot; </p>

Where Markets Go From Here: Wall Street&apos;s Biggest Names Weigh In -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Justin Baer </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Wall Street&apos;s seasoned executives have navigated market selloffs and economic downturns, disruptive hurricanes and even terrorist attacks. Many of them stood at the precipice in 2008, when the financial system they had helped lead faced one of its biggest challenges ever. </p>
<p>
     Those experiences may bear little direct relevance to the unprecedented challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, whose potential devastation remains difficult to comprehend. But for an industry that has always bet on its eventual recovery, they are all it has. </p>
<p>
     The Wall Street Journal asked some of the financial world&apos;s most-influential voices to predict how the markets will respond to government policies designed to contain the virus&apos;s impact, and how they&apos;re relying on their own past experiences to shape the decisions they&apos;re making as leaders and investors. Here&apos;s what they said. </p>
<p>
     Scott Minerd Global chief investment officer for Guggenheim Partners </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are running the risk that this will be another Great Depression. Despite the good intentions of the Fed and policymakers in Washington, the programs put in place won&apos;t offset a severe contraction in economic activity. I expect another 10-20% downside in equities, and double-digit high yield default rates within 12 months. </p>
<p>
     &quot;My experience in all kinds of markets, including the financial crisis, is that bottom fishing is the most expensive sport in the world. Investment-grade bonds have dropped like a rock in just a few weeks: Spreads have more than tripled to 373 basis points. But in the financial crisis [investment grade] bond spreads peaked at 618 bps. Things that are cheap can still get cheaper.&quot; </p>
<p>
     -- Justin Baer </p>
<p>
     Abigail Johnson Chairman and chief executive of Fidelity Investments </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s impossible to predict the direction of the markets. Investors face long odds in trying to time the ups and downs of the markets. Staying fully invested according to your asset allocation plan can give investors an opportunity to participate in the market&apos;s long-term upward trend. Investors need to be patient and disciplined, and have a plan. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Your plan can help guide you through periods like this. It can help to use what we call the investor mindset, which means staying focused on the long term and using a decision process that is analytical, logical, and grounded in empirical data.&quot; </p>
<p>
     -- Justin Baer </p>
<p>
     Walt Bettinger Chief executive of Charles Schwab Corp. </p>
<p>
     &quot;A threat to so many people&apos;s economic well being, health and their lives creates a more significant and far-reaching challenge than 2008... &quot;And in the markets, we haven&apos;t ever experienced a pandemic-driven bear market, so traditional signals about where we are headed may be of little help. That said, we know from history, over time, our country perseveres and its markets rebound. The hopelessness of the financial crisis of 2008 was followed by a historic bull market, but the pivot went almost unnoticed by many investors until we were well into the turnaround. And so throughout this downturn, we are reminding our clients that panic is not an investment strategy and that trying to time the market is futile.&quot; </p>
<p>
     -- Dawn Lim </p>
<p>
     Ben Meng Chief investment officer, California Public Employees&apos; Retirement System </p>
<p>
     &quot;We can&apos;t predict the future and we don&apos;t try to. We don&apos;t know how long this market volatility will last, but it reinforces what I know is one of CalPERS&apos; greatest strengths -- our long-term investment horizon.... </p>
<p>
     &quot;The lesson we&apos;ve learned over the years is to prepare for as many potential outcomes as possible, and then stay calm and disciplined and execute on our strategy. We have been preparing for a market downturn like this one. We have a plan and we are sticking to it.&quot; </p>
<p>
     -- Heather Gillers </p>
<p>
     William Ackman Pershing Square Capital Management </p>
<p>
     &quot;The news about the virus is going to get worse and worse in the next few weeks, but the good news is that people are responding,&quot; William Ackman said in an interview. </p>
<p>
     In February, Mr. Ackman watched the coronavirus spread in China and thought the only way to slow it was to shut down the economy. So he moved to protect his portfolio, spending $27 million on convertible default swaps as a hedge. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Ackman called for a 30-day shutdown of the U.S. and told CNBC on March 18 that &quot;hell is coming&quot; and the country wasn&apos;t moving fast enough to stem the spread. Markets slid as he spoke. </p>
<p>
     Though a full shutdown didn&apos;t happen, Mr. Ackman locked in the gains from his hedge earlier this week by closing it out for $2.6 billion, offsetting his stock losses. Mr. Ackman says he has grown more optimistic, and while his portfolio includes a relatively high level of cash, he has put more money into core holdings. &quot;I think we&apos;re heading in the right direction,&quot; he said, though he added that it&apos;s likely &quot;not going to be straight-line up.&quot; </p>
<p>
     -- Corrie Driebusch </p>
<p>
     Daniel Ivascyn Group chief investment officer, Pacific Investment Management Co. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are all facing a truly global and humanitarian challenge that we hope will be a once-in-a-lifetime event. We are working relentlessly to protect our employees and their families while navigating client portfolios through unprecedented financial market volatility. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The economy is rapidly contracting, but aggressive action by global central banks, coupled with unprecedented fiscal spending in the U.S. and much of the rest of the world, should keep credit flowing, give households and businesses a bridge to recovery and reduce the chances of a more severe depression. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The 2008 Financial Crisis was a different beast with different triggers but one thing holds true again: The cautious investors who came into this broadly diversified and owning high-quality and liquid assets now have better prospects of a quicker recovery.&quot; </p>
<p>
     -- Justin Baer </p>
<p>
     Nelson Peltz Trian Fund Management </p>
<p>
     Hedge-fund manager Nelson Peltz is currently in Florida, social distancing along with other Americans. When he takes a ride once a day to get out of the house, he likes to drive past a Wendy&apos;s -- the restaurant chain of which his fund, Trian Fund Management LP, is the largest shareholder. </p>
<p>
     While not as many people are using the drive-through as a few weeks ago, Mr. Peltz said in an interview that he&apos;s still pleased to see people lined up to get their food. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Peltz says the coronavirus pandemic, and the shortage of medical protective gear and other supplies, will fundamentally change supply chains, and that the U.S. will likely see more things being made in America. </p>
<p>
     In the near term, Mr. Peltz is feeling more upbeat after seeing the stimulus bill pass in the Senate, saying, &quot;the bill as written will help both companies and workers.&quot; </p>
<p>
     -- Corrie Driebusch </p>
<p>
     Bill Demchak CEO of PNC Financial Services Group Inc. </p>
<p>
     Bill Demchak is still coming into his office at PNC&apos;s Pittsburgh headquarters, though the building is almost empty. He has started wearing jeans and sporting a beard. </p>
<p>
     Many PNC employees are working from home. Branch employees are still coming into work, though the bank has scaled back its branch operations. </p>
<p>
     &quot;As a bank, we have to be here for all the obvious reasons: helping people defer payments, or make payments, or get new loans,&quot; Mr. Demchak said. &quot;So in effect we&apos;ve drafted these normal people who are used to coming to work and doing their job, and now they&apos;re almost emergency responders. They are people who have the same concerns as everybody else does, and they&apos;re being put in a situation where they can&apos;t necessarily behave like other people who can just sit and ride it out.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Demchak makes a point to walk down the street most days to visit employees at two nearby branches. &quot;Frankly you just applaud these employees,&quot; Mr. Demchak said. &quot;I&apos;m really grateful for what they are doing.&quot; </p>

Keywords: How to Monitor a Patient You Can&apos;t Touch -- WSJ</headline>

<p>
  Facing a deluge of Covid-19 patients, more hospitals leverage remote technology; checking vital signs from afar </p>
<pre>
By Christopher Mims | Photographs by Ryan Lowry for The Wall Street Journal </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     As American cities face a surge of coronavirus patients who will require lifesaving care, they are also facing a rapidly dwindling supply of available intensive-care-unit beds. Physicians and nurses at many of the country&apos;s largest hospital systems are leveraging a decades-old technology in new ways -- at times coupling it with cheap, readily available gadgets -- to expand their ability to care for and monitor patients. </p>
<p>
     Generally known as &quot;tele-ICU,&quot; this two-way bedside video is sort of like FaceTime or Zoom. The difference is that it typically adds a host of other technologies to videoconferencing, in order to connect critically ill patients in hospital ICU beds with teams of doctors and nurses who specialize in delivering care to the sickest, even when those teams are miles or even whole states away. </p>
<p>
     The technologies include high-definition cameras with pan, tilt and zoom abilities, so they can home in on anything in the hospital room, from the patient&apos;s face to the instruments at bedside. They also include direct connections to equipment like heart-rate and blood-pressure monitors. These traditionally expensive systems can connect remote specialists to the doctors and nurses at patients&apos; bedsides, often at smaller hospitals and in rural locations. </p>
<p>
     But to treat waves of patients struggling with Covid-19, doctors and technicians are also appropriating less expensive remote-monitoring tech to their arsenal of existing tele-ICU systems. It&apos;s the difference between spending tens of thousands of dollars a bed on top-of-the-line tech that could take weeks to be delivered and installed, and switching to systems that include commercial tablets and can be installed at patients&apos; bedsides immediately. </p>
<p>
     If things get really bad, medical providers could enlist the help of store-bought tablets and laptops, as they have in hurricanes and other past disasters. </p>
<p>
     In the sheer number of patients needing intensive care, coronavirus presents a trial far beyond any that such technology has been put through before. The result is an example of rapid innovation -- even disruption -- in action, as professionals are forced to improvise using only the gear at hand. By their own accounts, beyond finding it merely serviceable, they are developing and sharing new methods in real time. It&apos;s a medical hackathon in which lives are at stake and the papers analyzing what worked best may have to wait until after the catastrophe has passed. </p>
<p>
     As in other disasters or even wartime, the results show what&apos;s possible when people are asked to do the impossible and are freed to use any means necessary to accomplish it. It may be a taste of the medical innovation to come, as the entire world is forced to find ways to grapple with an accelerating pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The health professionals at Northwell Health, which includes 23 hospitals and 72,000 employees across New York state, are rapidly increasing the number of tele-ICU beds from 170 to 420, and say they could accommodate far more. (New York state has desperately tried to add to its 3,000 ICU beds; Gov. Andrew Cuomo has warned it might need 40,000.) </p>
<p>
     Swedish hospital system in Seattle, another coronavirus hot spot, is leveraging a variety of telehealth technologies, partly to keep health-care workers from being exposed to coronavirus and to keep patients at home when possible. </p>
<p>
     But of all of the programs to address shortages of health-care providers at Swedish, &quot;I think the tele-ICU capacity is the most important one at this time,&quot; says Elizabeth Meade, the medical director of pediatric quality and safety at Swedish. </p>
<p>
     The point of tele-ICU isn&apos;t to replace staff on premise, but to supplement them while also keeping the scarce supply of trained intensivists physically removed from patients to minimize their risks of infection. Doctors on the other side of the screens at patients&apos; bedsides can help with monitoring and can even use local staff as their &quot;hands&quot; when they need to manipulate something in the room. </p>
<p>
     Four hospitals in Atlanta&apos;s Emory Healthcare system are using tele-ICU technology to support staff. One example is easing the burden of monitoring stable patients when on-premise staff must intubate a Covid-19 patient, a procedure that requires extra people and effort due to the risk of infection, says Timothy Buchman, medical director of Emory&apos;s electronic ICU service. </p>
<p>
     &quot;In situations where requirements and demands are changing rapidly, the ability to move from one room to the next, or one hospital to the next, literally at the speed of light, allows us to make the most efficient allocation of what are increasingly scarce human resources,&quot; Dr. Buchman says. </p>
<p>
     Northwell has a telehealth command center in Syosset, N.Y., from which teams of critical-care physicians and nurses are already monitoring more than 130 beds, of which 116 are occupied by Covid-19 patients, says Kara Benneche, director of clinical operations of telehealth services at Northwell. </p>
<p>
     Physicians and nurses at Northwell&apos;s Syosset center sit at banks of six to eight monitors, connected to two-way video-conferencing systems that allow them to see and interact with patients and any health professionals in the patients&apos; rooms. The most elaborate of the bedside systems, produced by Philips under the trade name eCareManager, also gives doctors a live feed of a patient&apos;s vital signs. </p>
<p>
     &quot;That&apos;s the beauty of tele-ICU: One person sitting in a tele-ICU center can take care of 50 to 100 beds,&quot; says Saurabh Chandra, medical director of telehealth services at Northwell. Advanced tele-ICU systems make the monitoring of such numbers possible because they include software that alerts physicians when patients&apos; vital signs cross into dangerous territory, he adds. </p>
<p>
     But these devices, part of elaborate, expensive service packages for whole hospitals, can take time to install even under normal conditions. Facing a flood of new patients and obstacles to setting up new equipment, Northwell doctors are getting creative with tech they already have on hand. In December, Northwell ordered a batch of 35 movable carts with two-way video conferencing capability from American Well, which are scheduled to arrive in early April. </p>
<p>
     These carts were intended to be used in any department in any of Northwell&apos;s hospitals and other facilities. But many are being pressed into service in a variety of roles necessitated by the pandemic, including connecting to ICU beds. Physicians can access the carts&apos; cameras remotely from a computer. Carts are being sent wherever they&apos;re needed, across Northwell&apos;s hospital system, and can be wheeled from room to room. </p>
<p>
     This system can also save doctors and nurses who are on site from having to enter patients&apos; rooms, says Ms. Benneche. Remote practitioners using these systems can&apos;t do anything in patients&apos; rooms that requires their hands -- such as adjusting an IV or a ventilator. But they can check patients&apos; overall condition, and use the system&apos;s cameras to zoom in on bedside monitoring equipment, allowing them to check vital signs just as they would if they were in the room. Every time they do this, it saves them 10 to 15 minutes of suiting up in protective gear, she adds. </p>
<p>
     One challenge for the coronavirus patients is the isolation, with loved ones not allowed in. But while tele-ICU can also mean less human contact, nurses are on the other hand more readily available in at least one way: Patients who are able can touch a button at any time to talk to them, something they do frequently just to cope with loneliness, says Ms. Benneche. </p>
<p>
     SOC Telemed, which provides telemedicine technology to more than 600 hospitals across the U.S., will add 100 hospitals to its platforms in the next 45 days on account of the pandemic, says Jason Hallock, the company&apos;s chief medical officer. About one in seven ICU beds in the U.S. already have tele-ICU capability, he adds. </p>
<p>
     In 2018, SOC Telemed equipped Onslow Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville, N.C., with telemedicine capabilities, including tele-ICU, in just 18 hours when flooding from Hurricane Michael cut off the hospital from outside help. Using a telemedicine cart Onslow staff already had on hand, &quot;we took care of anyone from a newborn baby to someone in their late 90s, &quot; says Dr. Hallock. </p>
<p>
     Tele-ICU is only one part of what must be a much broader response to the coronavirus pandemic, emphasizes Eric Toner, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and author of a report on the ultimate impact of coronavirus on the U.S. &quot;I think [tele-ICU and related] strategies can improve our capacity to have trained people provide care, but I think they&apos;re limited,&quot; he adds. </p>
<p>
     One thing tele-ICU cannot do is remove existing barriers to which doctors can pitch in at any given hospital, notes Dr. Hallock. It can take 120 days for a physician to become authorized to work at a hospital. While &quot;emergency privileges&quot; can speed this process, for now the technology of allowing remote care is running far ahead of the system&apos;s ability to absorb physicians who could consult through it. Another issue is that states traditionally do not allow doctors to practice medicine without a license specific to that state, limiting the ability of out-of-state doctors to help. These aren&apos;t insuperable barriers -- Emory Healthcare previously set up a tele-ICU facility in Australia so health professionals there could cover the night shift at Emory&apos;s ICU units in the U.S. -- but they take time to overcome. </p>

<p>
     Martin Doerfler, a Northwell senior vice president in charge of telemedicine, says he is preparing his hospitals both for the initial peak of the virus, as well as what could be an even bigger peak come November, should coronavirus become seasonal like the common flu. </p>

     If it comes to that, teams of doctors at Northwell might have to connect to any tablet or mobile device through a web app, from their central tele-ICU center and remote centers it has set up at each of its hospitals. This option would be limited, lacking the pan and zoom capabilities of dedicated cameras, while offering only basic two-way communication between a remote physician and a patient or bedside nurse. </p>

     &quot;I&apos;m practicing now for hundreds -- or thousands -- of cases and hopefully not tens of thousands,&quot; says Dr. Doerfler. </p>

China Approves Goldman, Morgan -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jing Yang </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     China has cleared Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley to take majority control of their local securities businesses, taking a key step in opening up its financial markets to Wall Street. </p>
<p>
     The China Securities Regulatory Commission will allow the two banks to move to 51% ownership of their local joint ventures, Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co. and Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities Co., the two U.S. institutions said on Friday. Both had initially lodged applications around August last year. </p>
<p>
     Goldman Sachs is injecting new capital to increase its stake in its joint venture from 33%. It said it would move as soon as possible to migrate some business units that operate under its local partner, Beijing Gao Hua Securities, into the joint venture. Morgan Stanley will increase its stake in its Shanghai-based venture from 49%. </p>
<p>
     American financial firms, including investment banks, money managers and credit-card firms, have been trying to pry open China&apos;s markets for decades, and restrictions on their activity have been a focal point in President Trump&apos;s trade war with China. </p>
<p>
     The governments of the world&apos;s two biggest economies reached a trade deal in January that included awarding U.S. financial institutions better access to the Chinese market. </p>
<p>
     China increased the shareholding cap on local securities joint ventures to 51% in 2018, and UBS Group AG of Switzerland subsequently became the first foreign bank permitted to take majority control. Beijing later said it would remove ownership caps completely and allow 100% holdings as of this April. </p>
<p>
     Goldman Sachs said it would now seek full ownership of its unit &quot;at the earliest opportunity.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The approvals came just as China resurfaced from a nearly two-month nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. The U.S. and Chinese governments have traded barbs over the virus, but in the past day Mr. Trump and his counterpart, Xi Jinping, held a phone call, which the U.S. president described as a &quot;very good conversation.&quot; </p>
<p>
     JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in December received approval to set up a new 51%-owned securities joint venture in China. </p>

SEC Gives Firms Extra Time to File Reports in Pandemic -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Paul Kiernan, Mark Maurer and Dave Michaels </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- Public companies will have extra time to file annual reports and other major disclosures, as firms ranging from McDonald&apos;s Corp. to Hershey Co. brace for a financial hit from the new coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     The Securities and Exchange Commission has given companies an additional 45 days to file the periodic reports that investors depend on to learn about financial performance and developing risks. The relief applies to filings that companies would normally make between March 1 and July 1. </p>
<p>
     The situation isn&apos;t ideal for investors. Delays in financial reporting deprive them of the information they need to assess future performance, promoting higher capital costs, lower stock prices and more volatility. </p>
<p>
     &quot;A delay always raises a question: What are they not telling us, and why?&quot; said Paul Miller, a professor emeritus of accounting at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. &quot;The market&apos;s aggregate will respond with uncertainty by depressing share prices.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The SEC&apos;s measures reflect a growing recognition among policy makers and investors that it could take months to determine the economic impact of the pandemic and of efforts to contain it. </p>
<p>
     Surveys this week showed record declines in U.S. and European business activity in March, and some data suggest that many smaller companies -- particularly restaurants and retailers -- would struggle to survive a shutdown lasting longer than a few weeks. </p>
<p>
     &quot;As we cannot predict the duration or scope of the Covid-19 pandemic, the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material,&quot; McDonald&apos;s said in a filing Wednesday. </p>
<p>
     With a growing number of businesses shuttered to contain the virus, it may be impossible for many companies to assess accurately the value of inventory, goodwill, accounts receivable or securities held. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If all of a sudden most of your primary customers are looking at potential bankruptcy, you&apos;ve got to make massive write-downs in your accounts receivable,&quot; said J.W. Verret, a law professor at George Mason University. &quot;Accountants are facing an impossible task right now.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For companies such as the health-care logistics firm Owens &amp; Minor Inc., the task of preparing financial statements for the latest quarter has so far taken a back seat to the finance team&apos;s analysis of business divisions affected by the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;ve probably been more focused on customer-facing decisions at this point, and not as focused on our Q1 reporting of the numbers,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Andy Long said in an interview. &quot;It&apos;s something that, quite frankly, we&apos;re going to spend a little bit more time on going forward.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The latest round of SEC relief is similar to what regulators provided companies in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and superstorm Sandy in 2012, though much broader in geographic scope. </p>
<p>
     The SEC doesn&apos;t give companies free rein to withhold material information, however. </p>
<p>
     The agency issued guidance this week on how companies should update investors on business disruptions from the coronavirus, including whether work-from-home requirements might hurt their operations and accounting systems. </p>
<p>
     Some decisions may be trickier than usual, such as whether to book an impairment on assets that are less valuable owing to economic shock. Still, that information should be given to shareholders as quickly as possible, the SEC said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The commission is not going to second-guess business people who make disclosures in good faith, but they also make clear that if you knowingly or recklessly make misstatements, that will trigger enforcement,&quot; said Dick Walker, a partner at King &amp; Spalding LLP and a former SEC enforcement director. </p>
<p>
     Regulators have also noted the heightened chance of insider trading in the age of the coronavirus. Managers may have inside information about risks or business impacts stemming from the pandemic and should refrain from trading, the SEC&apos;s enforcement division said this week. </p>
<p>
     The SEC extended similar relief to some filings required of investment advisers and mutual funds if their operations have been affected by the pandemic. </p>

Banks Get a Break on Bad-Loan Accounting -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Andrew Ackerman </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators gave banks a reprieve from new accounting standards that require lenders to book losses on soured loans more quickly, the latest step designed to encourage banks to keep lending during the spread of the new coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Banks now have up to two additional years before they must set aside more capital for reserves against loan losses, as required by the new &quot;current expected credit loss,&quot; or CECL, accounting standard. </p>
<p>
     The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, also said they would speed up the implementation of a new methodology for measuring counterparty credit risk in derivatives transactions. </p>
<p>
     That move likely reduces the amount of capital lenders have to hold against such transactions because it recognizes improvements to the safety of the derivatives markets since the 2008 financial crisis. </p>

High-Frequency Traders Have a Feast In Volatile Market -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Scott Patterson and Alexander Osipovich </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Fast-trading investors have made big profits during the market&apos;s volatility, with strategies ranging from sophisticated computer algorithms to ones as simple as &quot;selling the rips and buying the dips.&quot; </p>
<p>
     High-frequency traders, which typically deploy sophisticated algorithms and powerful computers to move in and out of markets at lightning speeds, tend to do well when markets are volatile. </p>
<p>
     Virtu Financial Inc., one of the largest high-speed traders, last week said it expects to post trading income of between $509 million and $519 million in the first quarter, more than double the amount from the same period last year and its highest quarterly trading income since the company went public in 2015. </p>
<p>
     Virtu&apos;s results are &quot;a quarter for the record books,&quot; Piper Sandler analyst Richard Repetto wrote in a note. Virtu&apos;s stock is up 41% this year while the S&amp;P 500 is down 21%. The only other publicly traded high-speed trading firm, Amsterdam-based Flow Traders NV, is up 28% year to date. </p>
<p>
     High-frequency firms have struggled in recent years amid a period of low volatility and steadily rising markets. Still, they are estimated to account for around half the trading volume of the U.S. stock market, having largely replaced the floor traders who once controlled exchanges&apos; ebb and flow. Virtu is a designated market maker for the New York Stock Exchange. </p>
<p>
     Like market makers, high-speed traders often make money on the difference between buy and sell orders, known as the spread, by selling high and buying low as stocks tick up and down. Spreads in heavily traded stocks, such as Apple Inc., which are typically 1 or 2 cents, have ballooned to 30 cents or more in recent weeks because of the highly volatile, fast-moving markets. While wide spreads indicate riskier market conditions, firms that can exploit the difference can earn sizable profits. </p>
<p>
     Some plain-vanilla rapid-trading strategies are also faring well, traders said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Our traders are having some of their best months in years,&quot; said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading, a Las Vegas broker dealer that provides computer-driven trading platforms for day traders. He said one of the strategies that has worked best is &quot;selling the rips and buying the dips&quot; -- selling stocks after big moves higher and buying after sharp downturns. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Dick said traders are looking for stocks that get pushed too low or too high during big market swings that drag the entire market up or down. Right now, he said, many are buying stocks that are low in debt and selling stocks with lots of debt that will likely suffer as the economy deteriorates. If a low-debt stock gets pummeled during a big selloff, traders will swoop in and buy, expecting it to rebound. </p>
<p>
     Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers Group, an electronic brokerage popular among day traders, said daily volume handled by his firm has more than doubled to more than two million trades a day in the past three weeks. New accounts are also surging, he said, a sign that people confined to their homes might be turning to trading. </p>
<p>
     The losers among the computerized trading strategies, at least so far, are those that bet on longstanding correlations between different financial instruments. Such dislocations can cause losses in statistical arbitrage, or stat arb, strategies. </p>
<p>
     Among the correlations that broke down during the worst of the selloff last week were between stocks and Treasury-bond prices, which usually move in opposite directions. But during the recent selloff, investors fled both. &quot;Treasury selloffs on big down equity days mean that correlation is finally getting challenged,&quot; said Pav Sethi, chief investment officer at Gladius Capital Management, a Chicago trading firm. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sethi said another breakdown in correlations has been between stocks and a broad measure of market volatility, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, known as the fear index. Typically the VIX rises when stocks fall as fear spreads through Wall Street, and vice versa. While the VIX soared to record levels as the market plunged in recent weeks, the link hasn&apos;t always worked as expected. </p>
<p>
     Such haywire trading patterns mean trouble for quantitative investment firms, said David Magerman, a former executive at Renaissance Technologies, one of the biggest and most successful of what are known as quant firms. The models the firms deploy, often based on years of returns, get scrambled as investors head for the exits all at once. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The big jolts to the markets are a coin flip for quant funds,&quot; Mr. Magerman said. &quot;Once the markets calm...quant funds that are still around should clean up.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Although volatility has mostly benefited electronic trading firms, &quot;you can still be caught by surprise,&quot; said Rob Creamer, CEO of Chicago-based firm Geneva Trading. &quot;There are a lot of markets that have been so dislocated that it&apos;s been incredibly challenging.&quot; </p>
<p>
     One victim of the extreme moves was Ronin Capital LLC, a Chicago-based trading firm that incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in losses on strategies tied to the VIX, people familiar with the matter said. Futures-exchange operator CME Group Inc. said March 20 that it auctioned off some of Ronin&apos;s portfolios after it failed to meet capital requirements. </p>
<p>
     A person reached at Ronin&apos;s office didn&apos;t respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>
     Some quick-draw traders that don&apos;t use complex algorithms are also benefiting from the market&apos;s swings. Daniel Schlaepfer, CEO of Select Vantage, which has more than 2,000 day traders world-wide, said his firm&apos;s top 10 record days have occurred this month. Daily trading volumes across the firm have doubled since markets began their slide, he said. </p>
<p>
     Traders at Select Vantage typically hold stocks for less than 15 minutes and never sit on positions overnight, he said. In ways, the firm acts like a vast, human-driven high-frequency firm that rapidly buys and sells stocks throughout the day. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re way up. We&apos;re up full-force,&quot; Mr. Schlaepfer said. </p>

Mall Bears Count Up Gains As Shopping Centers Close -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Matt Wirz and Esther Fung </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Hedge-fund manager Marc Rosenthal&apos;s wager on the demise of U.S. shopping malls nearly crippled his business last year. Now the trade is delivering paper gains exceeding 100%, a rare win amid the market carnage caused by the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Rosenthal&apos;s investment firm, MP Securitized Credit Partners, has been betting for almost two years that an index tracking debt from malls across the country would decline in value as in-store shopping declined. It is a strategy that fueled big losses in 2019, before fallout from the coronavirus halted traffic at malls, hotels, movie theaters and other properties in the index. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We always knew in our heart of hearts the trade was right,&quot; Mr. Rosenthal said, after the index lost half its value in a matter of days. &quot;I just can&apos;t believe it happened so fast.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The index, known as CMBX 6, tracks the performance of 25 mortgage-backed bonds that bundle debt from commercial properties, including around 40 malls, many that are in small or struggling markets. Investors betting those malls can pay their debts make out when the index rises, and doubters when it falls. </p>
<p>
     For much of past year, the trade looked bleak. It pitted Mr. Rosenthal&apos;s roughly $250 million firm against mutual-fund giants AllianceBernstein Holding LP and Putnam Investments, whose bullish bets drove the index higher. Mr. Rosenthal&apos;s fund lost about 30% in 2019. Many other hedge funds with similar &quot;short&quot; trades tapped out. </p>
<p>
     AllianceBernstein and Putnam said they remain confident of their holdings, pointing out that debt losses could still be contained even if there is greater economic distress. </p>
<p>
     One of the riskiest slices of the index fell to about 46 this week from around 84 at the start of the month, according to data from IHS Markit. MP&apos;s main fund, which includes other investments, has gained about 75% this year while a smaller fund launched last month solely to bet against the index has returned more than 100%. Those gains will remain unrealized until the index contracts fully pay out or are sold. </p>
<p>
     &quot;You could make a clear case for either side of the trade,&quot; said Manus Clancy, senior managing director at real-estate data provider Trepp LLC. While the headwinds facing retailers are undeniable, many troubled malls can negotiate with lenders to avoid default for years, propping up the index. </p>
<p>
     The trade attracted the attention of billionaire investor Carl Icahn late last year when he began betting against the index. </p>
<p>
     Formerly a subprime mortgage investor at Credit-Based Asset Servicing &amp; Securitization LLC, or C-BASS, Mr. Rosenthal co-founded his fund with Noelle Savarese in 2008 to buy mortgage debt on the cheap. </p>
<p>
     The bet against malls traces back to 2018, when Principal Dan McNamara and Managing Director Catie McKee started analyzing whether to bet against the CMBX 6. It was an idea being circulated among hedge funds by Eric Yip, an investor who had once worked as an analyst for Mr. Icahn before starting his own fund, Alder Hill Management, principally to short the index. </p>
<p>
     The premise was that online shopping and a glut of malls in the U.S. would push many second- and third-tier shopping centers into default on their mortgages. Mr. McNamara and Ms. McKee began visiting malls around the country that are included in the index, paying close attention to vulnerable locations like the Fashion Outlets of Las Vegas in Primm, Nev., and the Crystal Mall in Waterford, Conn. </p>
<p>
     MP started buying swap contracts on a slice of the index in the summer of 2018, when it traded around 80, agreeing to pay annual premiums for default insurance from AllianceBernstein and others who were bullish on the index. If the index rose, MP would owe more money to its contract counterparty, but if it fell, MP would be owed the price difference. The firm eventually bought contracts worth more than $500 million, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>
     The screws tightened on MP, Alder Hill and other funds betting against CMBX 6 starting in January 2019. Counterparties such as AllianceBernstein and Putnam kept selling more insurance, driving the price of the index up. </p>
<p>
     Exhausted by years of waiting for CMBX 6 to crack and mounting paper losses, Mr. Yip closed Alder Hill in September, a person close to the fund said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Rosenthal hung on but the index kept rising, peaking around 89, and some clients said they wanted out of the trade, forcing him to restructure his fund late last year. A group of MP&apos;s clients moved into investment vehicles with no exposure to the CMBX short. </p>
<p>
     Those who stuck with the strategy began to see daylight in January, when the index started to fall because of rising worry about the economic impact of the coronavirus. &quot;It is the recession component that really drove this down,&quot; Mr. Rosenthal said. MP and Icahn watched their losses turn to gains. </p>
<p>
     As retail activity slowed in February, MP launched a new fund to make more short bets on CMBX 6 but, after his experience in 2019, Mr. Rosenthal demanded new investors commit to an extended investment period. Those investors have since doubled their money. </p>
<p>
     &quot;When we made the new investment vehicle we thought we&apos;d have to lock investors up for three years for it to work,&quot; Mr. Rosenthal said. &quot;The price movement we expected happened in three weeks.&quot; </p>

U.S. Crude Set for Worst Year Since &apos;03 -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By David Hodari </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     U.S. crude is set for its worst year since 2003, as the coronavirus pandemic drags oil demand lower in the second quarter, investment banks predict. </p>
<p>
     Futures for West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. benchmark, are expected to trade at an average of $34.95 a barrel in 2020, according to a poll of 11 major banks conducted by The Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>
     The banks also forecast that Brent crude, the global benchmark, will average $38.12 this year, its lowest since 2004. Brent is expected to stay below $28 a barrel in the second quarter, and WTI below $25, the poll showed. </p>
<p>
     Brent crude slipped 0.7% to $28.44 a barrel Friday, on course to close out the first quarter at a 57% loss. WTI futures were flat at $22.60 a barrel, after shedding 63% of their value since Jan. 1. </p>
<p>
     Those historic declines have followed the imposition of citizen lockdowns by governments around the globe in response to the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, an impasse in production cut talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia -- two of the world&apos;s largest producers -- has sparked an oil-price war, with both sides and other oil exporters vowing to slash selling prices and ramp up production in an attempt to capture greater market share. </p>
<p>
     Investors had hoped that an extraordinary meeting Thursday of the leaders of the Group of 20 -- an alliance of the world&apos;s largest economies -- would offer an opportunity for Saudi Arabia and Russia to ratchet down tensions. While the meeting produced no statement that related to oil, the coronavirus and its impact far outweighs any action oil producers might take, analysts say. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Any producer action is rendered mute as long as demand estimates keep getting revised lower,&quot; said Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas. </p>
<p>
     This week has seen several organizations slash demand forecasts, with the heads of both the International Energy Agency and Vitol Group -- one of the world&apos;s largest independent oil traders -- saying global oil demand may drop by 20 million barrels a day, or 20%, in the coming weeks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said this week demand will fall 18.7 million barrels a day in April. </p>
<p>
     After the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies failed to agree to additional cuts earlier this month, the forecast plunge in demand means &quot;supply will have to adjust and we&apos;re looking at the fact that prices will have to go lower and force shut-ins in U.S. shale supply and likely elsewhere,&quot; Mr. Tchilinguirian said. </p>
<p>
     If the banks are correct in their forecasts, U.S. oil companies will be selling oil either at or below the cost of production during the course of the year. On average, it cost U.S. producers $35.90 to produce a barrel of oil, according to Rystad Energy. </p>
<p>
     In the past, the impact of low prices on the U.S. shale industry has taken a while to filter through, according to Jamie Webster, senior director at the Boston Consulting Group Center for Energy Impact. &quot;This time will be different and there&apos;s potential for there to be shut-ins as you&apos;re well below operating expenditure prices,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Brazilian state-owned producer Petr&#243;leo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, on Thursday became the first big producer to cut production, citing the demand impact of Covid-19. </p>
<p>
     Brazil has less than two days-worth of storage capacity left, according to IHS Markit data, and producers in Canada, Norway and Mexico all have less than a weeks&apos; worth of space. </p>

Heard on the Street: Grocery Delivery&apos;s Unexpected Stress Test -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Supermarkets weren&apos;t ready for the surge in online orders, but they&apos;re learning on the fly </p>
<pre>
By Carol Ryan </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     If the Covid-19 outbreak provides a global test for buying food online, it is one that supermarkets are by and large failing. Yet their e-commerce businesses should be in a different league after the crisis. </p>
<p>
     Since the pandemic began, the websites of major food retailers have been as inundated as their physical stores. Pressure on these still-small online operations is only likely to increase as more nations place their populations on full lockdown. </p>
<p>
     Average daily traffic to Walmart&apos;s grocery site reached 1.1 million between March 1 and March 20, according to analytics company SimilarWeb -- a 55% increase on average daily visitor numbers during the previous two months. Kroger, Peapod, Instacart, Carrefour and Tesco have also experienced big surges in daily traffic. The number of U.S. households ordering groceries online roughly doubled this month to 40 million compared with levels recorded in August 2019, data released Thursday by consulting firm Brick Meets Click shows. </p>
<p>
     Although supermarkets have invested heavily in their online businesses in recent years, they are not ready for current levels of demand. Infrastructure is still immature globally: 7.6% of groceries in the U.K. were bought over the web before the outbreak, while in Spain just 2.4% of sales have moved online, according to Kantar data. The U.S. has around 3.1% penetration. </p>
<p>
     During the pandemic, it is proving harder to ramp-up capacity quickly online than in physical stores. Automated warehouses in the U.K., like the ones that Kroger is currently building with grocery-tech company Ocado in the U.S., need time to increase output. And getting additional delivery vans on the roads is complicated by the fact that they need to be specially kitted out with refrigerators for chilled orders. </p>
<p>
     That is leading to a frustrating experience for web shoppers in many markets. U.S. consumers face delays when using the services of retailers such as Walmart and Amazon Fresh. Ocado, which runs one of the most advanced e-commerce operations in the U.K. in partnership with local retailer Marks &amp; Spencer, is no longer accepting new customer registrations. The risk is that some consumers trying the service for the first time will be turned off for good. </p>
<p>
     Still, some retailers are betting that the extra demand will stick. Ahold Delhaize, owner of the Peapod delivery service, has doubled its server capacity in the U.S. since the crisis began. Its website will be able to handle much higher order volumes after the spike subsides. </p>
<p>
     The rush of orders is bringing some benefits. Online grocers are learning how to allocate delivery slots most efficiently in times of peak demand. They are testing in real time how different order-fulfillment methods, such as manual picking in stores or from dedicated online warehouses, perform under stress. </p>
<p>
     But the constrained capacity online also has one important advantage. Sales delivered to a shopper&apos;s home are far less profitable than those made in stores. Grocers need time to manage the shift online to avoid a big hit to their already thin operating margins. </p>
<p>
     Online grocery businesses may be struggling at the moment, but they will emerge from their unexpected trial better equipped for the future. </p>

Heard on the Street: ETFs Prove Their Mettle in a Crisis -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Exchange-traded bond funds emerge as an intergral part of today&apos;s financial architecture </p>
<pre>
By Jon Sindreu </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     What doesn&apos;t kill a useful financial instrument will probably make it stronger. </p>
<p>
     During both the coronavirus selloff and this week&apos;s bounce, big gaps have opened up between the value of exchange-traded bond funds and that of their holdings. Over the past two weeks, the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF -- the largest of its type -- has traded at both its largest discount and its largest premium to net asset value in 11 years. </p>
<p>
     ETFs have long been a popular way for investors to track equity indexes, but over the past decade they have come to dominate bond markets too. Many professional investors, however, suspect them of posing a 2008-style systemic risk -- fears to which signs of stress lend weight. </p>
<p>
     The issue, they argue, is that ETF shares are easy to trade in good times, obscuring the fact that many of the corporate bonds held -- particularly those rated below investment grade -- become hard to sell in bad times. This illiquidity can then spread to the ETFs, which are passive vehicles that can&apos;t remove problematic issues from their baskets. As investors rush to sell their ETF shares, the pain could infect even resilient bonds. </p>
<p>
     Furthermore, middlemen may find it hard to buy and cancel shares -- which is how ETF liquidity is ultimately backstopped -- because doing so would involve absorbing illiquid bonds that would be prohibitively expensive to hedge. </p>
<p>
     So far, though, this nightmare contagion scenario hasn&apos;t played out, despite extreme market moves. While the iShares ETF and its sister junk-bond product recently experienced their largest outflows on record, activity in the &quot;primary&quot; market -- where banks create and destroy shares -- hasn&apos;t been abnormally elevated relative to the high turnover of the ETFs&apos; shares on stock exchanges. ETFs have essentially been able to rely on their own liquidity, rather than that of the underlying bonds. </p>
<p>
     This is fundamentally different from 2008 when investors abandoned complex credit derivatives even as some of the underlying mortgage-backed securities pared the blow. In this case, ETF prices have become &quot;the effective benchmark prices of the underlying market,&quot; analysts at French bank Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale point out. Bond prices may need to catch up, but this doesn&apos;t mean something is fundamentally broken. </p>
<p>
     Some ETF prices may now be more &quot;real&quot; than the markets they track -- a reversal that should interest the philosophically inclined. This isn&apos;t unlike how oil futures contracts have superseded actual spot transactions as a way to measure the price of crude. </p>
<p>
     In today&apos;s globalized, highly complex financial markets, top-down macroeconomic information may simply be more relevant than bottom-up facts. During the coronavirus selloff in particular, traders have often been clueless about the worth of individual issues, while still having strong views about the economic shock. They have expressed them primarily through ETFs, but also through index-based credit-default swaps -- another way to bet on the broader corporate-bond market. </p>
<p>
     Investors should still avoid complex, poorly designed ETFs, like the inverse-volatility ones that imploded in 2018, or those that track assets too illiquid to have a reasonable price. But the fact that even junk-bond ETFs are functioning properly suggests that the threshold is higher than some feared. </p>
<p>
     For those still doubtful, the U.S. Federal Reserve&apos;s announcement this week that it would buy shares in investment-grade corporate-bond ETFs as part of its stimulus policies -- even though it is also directly buying the underlying bonds -- sends an &quot;all clear&quot; signal. This is a piece of financial engineering that has become too useful to fail. </p>

OVERHEARD -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Dan Gallagher </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Zoom has been one of the hottest stocks on the market this year -- just not the Zoom you think. </p>
<p>
     Shares of Zoom Technologies have surged 10-fold since the first of the year. But most of those traders likely think they are buying Zoom Video Communications. The latter is a Silicon Valley wunderkind that developed a videoconferencing service, which has proven to be hugely popular with a world now stuck working at home. The former is a Chinese company that once made modems and hasn&apos;t filed any public financial documents since 2015. </p>
<p>
     Some confusion is understandable. Zoom Technologies benefits from having the more intuitive ticker symbol ZOOM. It also benefits from being very hard to find. A Google search for &quot;Zoom Technologies Investor Relations&quot; leads to Zoom Video&apos;s IR page. The Securities and Exchange Commission appears to have had enough. The agency announced Thursday that it has suspended trading on ZOOM, citing &quot;the public interest and the protection of investors&quot; in its orders. </p>
<p>
     They should have known something was amiss earlier on. Zoom Video went public last April in one of the hottest IPOs of the year, and it had an immediate effect on trades of the other Zoom. Daily trading volume of Zoom Technologies averaged just 384 shares in the three months leading up to Zoom Video&apos;s first S-1 filing. On Zoom Video&apos;s first day of trading, Zoom Technologies&apos; volume came just under 1 million. Investors who picked up the wrong ZOOM for a buck a share at the first of this year could have sold those for $20 a piece at the end of last week. Not bad for a sucker&apos;s play. </p>

Heard on the Street: Drugmakers See Plans For New Drugs Upended -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Charley Grant </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Pharmaceutical companies tend to be relatively safe places to invest during economic shocks, but even they aren&apos;t immune to the pinch from Covid-19. </p>
<p>
     After all, demand for prescription medication is mostly insensitive to the economy, and seasonality plays a limited role in the business. Drug companies have strong balance sheets and pay stable dividends -- desirable investment traits in a weak economy. And in the short term, prescription activity could actually increase as patients stock up on medication. </p>
<p>
     But so far this year, big drugmakers haven&apos;t been much of a haven. A broad index of pharmaceutical stocks is down about 15% so far this year through Thursday. That isn&apos;t much better than the benchmark S&amp;P 500, which has lost 21%. </p>
<p>
     One difference is that the major economic shocks in recent history weren&apos;t caused by a health crisis. This time, the chaotic state of hospitals across the U.S. and Europe will impact the actual business of drug development -- the source of future revenue for research-led companies. </p>
<p>
     Earlier this week, Eli Lilly said it would delay the start of most new studies and pause enrollment in most trials that are already under way, though trials will continue for patients who have enrolled. Smaller biotech companies, like Bluebird Bio, also have announced delays in eventual regulatory reviews for experimental drugs. </p>
<p>
     Many health-care systems have had to  restructure operations to care for a surge in patients with Covid-19 -- the potentially deadly respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus -- and &quot;limit or cease&quot; other activities, Lilly said in a press release. Trial enrollees might need to stay home in the era of social distancing, especially those who are ill. </p>
<p>
     What is more, many drug companies have diverted their research efforts toward solving the Covid-19 health emergency. That is obviously the right thing to do for patients, but treatments for the disease are unlikely to be major business opportunities for the industry. </p>
<p>
     That shift of resources won&apos;t impact financial results right away: Bristol-Myers Squibb said last week that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved its new multiple-sclerosis treatment. </p>
<p>
     But the delays are bound to weaken research productivity over time. There are nearly 150,000 trials under way for experimental drugs, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association. Most drug candidates fail to reach the market, and the successful ones often take years to develop. The process is expensive: Total research and development spending reached $80 billion in 2018, according to a drug industry trade group. </p>
<p>
     Slowed-down development is an obvious worry for smaller biotech stocks, which often don&apos;t generate sales or profits and rely on access to the capital markets to fund operations. But bigger companies aren&apos;t exempt from the pressure. Bestselling drugs typically earn windfall profits until patents expire, when sales can decline sharply. If new drugs don&apos;t arrive to replace older ones facing generic competition, profits could become squeezed in the years ahead. </p>
<p>
     Drug investors should be monitoring this condition carefully. </p>

The Numbers: What Will It Take to Flatten the Curve? -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jo Craven McGinty </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     By now you&apos;ve heard the phrase &quot;flatten the curve.&quot; </p>
<p>
     It refers to the quest to slow transmissions of Covid-19 so the accumulating number of infections looks like a gentle slope instead of a vertiginous spike. </p>
<p>
     The matter is urgent, according to infectious-disease experts who&apos;ve modeled strategies to curb the spread. Reining in the virus, they say, requires immediate and drastic social distancing. To be effective, the interventions must last for months -- not just days or weeks -- and to avoid overloading hospitals, they must cut transmissions by more than half. </p>
<p>
     If instead the virus is allowed to multiply unchecked, a deluge of patients is expected to overwhelm health-care systems that aren&apos;t equipped to handle the number of people who will need treatment. </p>
<p>
     Already, the U.S. has confirmed more than 97,000 cases, a figure that has doubled or tripled every three days for nearly a month. </p>
<p>
     With widespread transmissions, even a fraction of critically-ill patients could strain hospitals. Experts at Imperial College London in collaboration with the World Health Organization project that 4.4% of Covid-19 infections will require hospitalization. Of that number, 30% will need critical care, such as a ventilator. And half of the critically ill patients will die. </p>
<p>
     In the absence of interventions, that means 2.2 million Americans and 510,000 Britons could die, according to the projections, with hospitals&apos; critical-care capacity exceeded as early as the second week of April. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The world is facing the most serious public health crisis in generations,&quot; Neil Ferguson, director of Imperial College&apos;s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, said in a prepared statement. (He developed symptoms last week and self-isolated.) </p>
<p>
     The Imperial College researchers evaluated two strategies to flatten the curve: mitigation focused on slowing but not stopping the virus&apos;s spread and suppression aimed at reducing the average number of person-to-person transmissions to less than one. (It&apos;s currently around 2.2). </p>
<p>
     Only suppression -- the most disruptive intervention -- would prevent the health-care systems in the U.S. and U.K. from being overwhelmed, they predict. </p>
<p>
     Suppressing the virus, according to their model, would require population-wide social distancing combined with home isolation of people with symptoms and school and university closings. The interventions would need to begin before hospitals become overwhelmed and remain in place for at least five months -- perhaps longer. </p>
<p>
     Abandoning the strategy before a vaccine or other treatment is developed and administered, they warn, could allow the pandemic to rebound. </p>
<p>
     The evidence of that potential outcome is the 1918 flu pandemic, when cities that closed schools, churches, bars and other social venues reduced case numbers and mortality only to see transmissions resurge when the interventions were lifted. </p>
<p>
     The researchers acknowledge there are many uncertainties, but they believe this strategy is the one most likely to ensure new infections won&apos;t exceed U.S. and U.K. hospitals&apos; critical-care capacity -- although they declined to estimate how many people might still die if these precautions are taken. </p>
<p>
     &quot;That&apos;s just too difficult to give a clear answer to at the present time, &quot; said Steven Riley, a professor of infectious-disease dynamics at Imperial College London who worked on the analysis. &quot;If we look at China, they have achieved very low levels of incidence, so we would forecast very few deaths in the near future.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The less aggressive strategy of mitigation modeled by the researchers calls for home isolation of people with symptoms of Covid-19, voluntary home quarantine of confirmed cases and social distancing of people older than 70 (the group most at risk). Policies for isolation and quarantine would endure for three months, while requirements for social distancing of those over age of 70 would remain in place for one month longer. </p>
<p>
     If this were done, the researchers predicted around 1.1 million Americans and 250,000 Britons would die, and demand for hospital critical-care beds would exceed the supply by a factor of eight. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Perhaps our most significant conclusion is that mitigation is unlikely to be feasible without emergency surge-capacity limits of the U.K. and U.S. health-care systems being exceeded many times over,&quot; the researchers wrote in their analysis. </p>
<p>
     They acknowledge that no public-health intervention as disruptive or enduring as what they recommend has been attempted previously, and they didn&apos;t analyze the social or economic hardships such extreme measures might cause. </p>
<p>
     But one way to reduce the disruption, they said, would be to implement adaptive restrictions that are eased or tightened as transmissions of the virus ebb and flow, using the number of cases at any given time as a trigger to switch interventions on or off. </p>
<p>
     In a study published this week, researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who examined intermittent distancing found that an &quot;on&quot; threshold of 37.5 cases per 10,000 people would keep the number of critical-care patients below 0.89 per 10,000 adults. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The need for intense social distancing is very strong,&quot; said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who contributed to the work. &quot;People who get infected today take an average of around three weeks before they are sick enough to need intensive care, if they&apos;re going to get that sick.&quot; </p>
<p>
     We have to act now, he said, to protect ourselves three weeks from now. </p>

New York Feels &apos;Like the Twilight Zone&apos; -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<pre>
By Rebecca Davis O&apos;Brien, Will Parker and Charles Passy </pre>
<p>
     Before dawn on Wednesday, Brian Levy, a union electrician, drove into work in Manhattan&apos;s Financial District from his home on Long Island. The commute, normally clogged by traffic, took half as long -- the roads were nearly empty. </p>
<p>
     From his perch working on the upper floors of 222 Broadway, Mr. Levy looks out on a silent city: darkened windows, deserted streets, shuttered businesses. Blocks south, as markets opened on Wednesday morning, an empty cobblestone plaza gave the New York Stock Exchange the air of a mausoleum. There is no morning rush hour at the Oculus transportation hub in the shadow of the World Trade Center. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s like the Twilight Zone,&quot; Mr. Levy said. &quot;That energy you get from New York -- it&apos;s all the people. Now there&apos;s no people. It feels like you are in a quiet, sleepy town.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The eerie silence that has settled over New York is all the more striking because of the chaos unfolding, largely out of sight, in the city&apos;s hospitals, which officials say are running out of room and equipment. The wails of ambulances pierce the air of quiet neighborhoods; nearly empty subway trains ferry health-care workers around the clock. </p>
<p>
     New York City has ground to a near halt as it battles the new coronavirus pandemic. The scope and speed of the change to the city streetscape -- and the growing human toll -- has left many New Yorkers reaching for comparisons with past moments of collective trauma, like 9/11 and Superstorm Sandy. </p>
<p>
     Thousands of restaurants and small businesses are shuttered, leaving tens of thousands of workers without jobs. Sent home on the orders of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, office workers no longer crowd Midtown lunch stands. </p>
<p>
     By Wednesday, the disease had killed 192 people in New York City, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than half of New York state&apos;s 31,000 confirmed cases are in the city. </p>
<p>
     The tourist engines of the city have shut down. The lights of Broadway still advertise for canceled shows. The sidewalk outside Macy&apos;s flagship store, in normally jam-packed Herald Square, is so quiet you can hear nearby HVAC systems humming. </p>
<p>
     The few sightseers remaining step freely into the streets to capture views of a deserted New York. City cops leave their cars to take selfies in the middle of empty intersections. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s like 6 a.m. on a Sunday morning, but all the time.&quot; said Brian O&apos;Flaherty, an office building manager still commuting every day from Long Island. </p>
<p>
     During Tuesday&apos;s evening rush hour, the daily White House press briefing projected from one of Times Square&apos;s largest LED screens. </p>
<p>
     The shop windows in Midtown&apos;s Diamond District were bare -- no diamonds, just unadorned necklace stands. It was the same in a nearly deserted Chinatown on Tuesday night: nearly all the noodle shops, tea houses, restaurants and other businesses were completely closed. On Chinatown&apos;s &quot;Funeral Row,&quot; the storefront shelves at Fook On Sing Funeral Supplies Inc. were completely empty. Normally, the windows there are full of miniature models of sports cars and mansions, so the dead may enjoy these luxuries in the afterlife. </p>
<p>
     The dim corridors of Penn Station typically teem with commuters. Now the daily racket of rolling luggage, squeaking sneakers and buzzing conversation has been replaced with soft jazz, played over the building&apos;s PA system. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is the cleanest and clearest I&apos;ve ever seen it,&quot; said Netta Arnold, a therapist from Orange, N.J., who was among just a handful of people waiting for a commuter train. </p>
<p>
     Even in normal times, New Yorkers have a particular understanding of personal space. They will generally tolerate being pressed tight against strangers in a packed subway car, but bristle at a stranger who sits too close if the train is empty. Crowds are part of the deal, so be mindful of your surroundings. </p>
<p>
     The coronavirus has altered and magnified this dynamic. Some sidewalks aren&apos;t wide enough to allow passing pedestrians to keep the 6-foot distance recommended by authorities, so they turn their heads, or step aside with a solemn nod, or veer into the streets. In stores and on subways, people without face masks guard their mouths and noses behind zipped-up jackets and scarfs. </p>
<p>
     There are still pockets of crowds. As New Yorkers have withdrawn from Manhattan offices, activity has picked up in other boroughs like Queens and Brooklyn, where over half the city lives. On warm afternoons, Prospect Park in Brooklyn is thronged with cyclists, runners, kids playing roller hockey. </p>
<p>
     The city shutdown -- mandatory, but difficult to enforce -- has touched off disputes about proper social-distancing practices. Set foot on a basketball court, or post a picture from a crowded sidewalk, and you&apos;ll hear about it. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I just want people to get with the program,&quot; said Jan Combopiano, a voting-rights activist from Brooklyn. </p>
<p>
     The shutdown has also drawn people together -- from a socially acceptable distance. </p>
<p>
     Jim Walton, a veteran Broadway actor who grew up in Indiana, said the virus has made New Yorkers more friendly, in a small-town way. &quot;I&apos;ve waved and smiled at people as if we&apos;re all in this together,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Supplies still arrive at Satoru Yasumatsu&apos;s two Japanese restaurants in Manhattan&apos;s Flatiron District, which are open for delivery and takeout. Unusually, the supplies are coming on time, thanks to quiet streets, he said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;When I go to the restaurant in the morning, it feels like I&apos;m walking late at night.&quot; When he returns home at night, he has been struck by how few apartments have lights on. Some New Yorkers have chosen to leave the city to wait out the illness in quieter non-urban areas -- although President Trump recently ordered anybody leaving the city to quarantine for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Yasumatsu has seen the city go quiet before. He was in the city for the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. </p>
<p>
     &quot;But this is totally different,&quot; he said. </p>

Police Practices Are Changing As Pandemic Grips the Country -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Zusha Elinson and Ben Chapman </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Law and order is changing across America during the novel coronavirus pandemic, as police pull back on arrests for small-time crimes and instead focus on breaking up gatherings that pose health risks, all the while coping with the perils of a job that can&apos;t be done with social distancing. </p>
<p>
     In Houston, three officers have tested positive for the coronavirus after apprehending a mentally ill man on the streets last week who had flulike symptoms. </p>
<p>
     &quot;You can&apos;t exercise social distancing when you&apos;re taking police action,&quot; said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo. &quot;It&apos;s part of the risk we take.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In New York City, 236 police employees have tested positive, and 8.9% of the New York Police Department&apos;s uniformed officers called in sick Wednesday, more than three times as high as a normal day. </p>
<p>
     Large agencies like New York&apos;s can use overtime and staggered shifts to cover for sick or quarantined officers, but most of the country&apos;s 18,000 police departments can&apos;t. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you&apos;ve got a department of 50 officers and you get 10 of them that get it, that&apos;s really a difficult issue,&quot; said Tom Manger, retired police chief of Montgomery County, Md. &quot;On the flip side, most departments are seeing many fewer calls for service and the crime rates are really plummeting because no one&apos;s out.&quot; </p>
<p>
     So far, crime has fallen on the empty streets of most big U.S. cities., including San Francisco, the first major city to order residents to stay at home.  Serious crimes in New York City were down last week compared with the same previous week a year ago, except for a 50% increase in car thefts. In Chicago, both violent and property crime are slightly below normal levels. In Dallas, violent and property crimes fell last week compared with the previous week. </p>
<p>
     But law-enforcement officials are paying close attention to the ripple effects of paring back law-enforcement, mass layoffs and lockdown orders. With more people at home, police expect domestic violence to rise. With many shops closed, burglaries and thefts could increase, too. </p>
<p>
     To help slow the spread of the virus, police chiefs are directing their officers not to arrest people for minor offenses and instead cite and release them. In Philadelphia, police are delaying arrests for nonviolent crimes like drug offenses and prostitution. In Los Angeles, where eight officers have tested positive, petty criminals aren&apos;t being taken to jail in some cases. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are encouraging citing and releasing individuals for low-level nonviolent offenses and that is so we limit everybody&apos;s exposure,&quot; said Josh Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. </p>
<p>
     Dallas police will no longer show up in person to take reports for car break-ins, graffiti and other minor offenses. Instead, residents must file reports online. Two officers there have tested positive. </p>
<p>
     In Chicago, arrests over the past week were down 46%, and traffic stops and investigatory stops were down 60% compared with the same period last year. In Dallas, there have been 45% fewer arrests to date in March compared with the same period last year. New York City had a 42% drop last week when compared the same week last year. In Los Angeles County, arrests dropped from around 300 a day in normal times to about 60. </p>
<p>
     In cities and states where residents have been ordered to stay at home and nonessential businesses have been ordered to close, officers are shifting their time and energy to policing a new social order. </p>
<p>
     Officers in New York City are patrolling parks to enforce social distancing, visiting restaurants and bars to make sure they are closed, and visiting supermarket and public spaces to make sure crowds are thin. </p>
<p>
     In Warrenton, Mo., police arrested 26-year-old Cody Pfister for making a terrorist threat after he posted a widely shared video of himself licking items at a Walmart and saying, &quot;Who&apos;s scared of coronavirus?&quot; </p>
<p>
     His lawyer, Patrick Coyne, said the situation is far different than when the video was made on March 10. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Everything has changed at warp speed, but that should not work retroactively and convert a tasteless and impulsive act into a criminal terrorist threat,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Like many on the front lines of the pandemic, police are struggling with short supplies of face masks. They are also scrambling to sanitize squad cars that are occupied by a variety of cops and suspected lawbreakers. </p>
<p>
     Officers on dangerous assignments are faced with decisions about whether to wear protective gear or not. Frederick Frazier, a Dallas police detective, said he chose not to wear gloves last week when a fugitive task force he is part of searched for violent offenders. &quot;We&apos;re not used to those gloves with our weapons,&quot; Det. Frazier said. </p>
<p>
     But some of the fugitives were taking no chances, he said. As they closed in to arrest an alleged marijuana dealer in East Dallas who was wanted for pointing a gun at a police officer, Det. Frazier could see that the suspect was wearing bright blue surgical gloves as he plied his trade. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Man, I don&apos;t want to catch corona!&quot; the man said, according to Det. Frazier. </p>

Admit Rates Edge Up At Ivy League Schools -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Melissa Korn </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Some of the nation&apos;s most selective colleges became slightly less selective this year, as Harvard University, Dartmouth College and the University of Pennsylvania posted increased acceptance rates for the first-year class that will begin in the fall. </p>
<p>
     Harvard admitted 1,980 candidates, or 4.9% of the 40,248 who applied. Last year, it offered spots to 30 fewer students, while receiving almost 3,100 additional applications, for a record-low 4.6% acceptance rate. </p>
<p>
     Dartmouth, meanwhile, accepted 8.8% of applicants, up from a record-low 7.9% last year. And Columbia University&apos;s admit rate rose to 6.1% from 5.3%, as applications dropped by almost 2,500 and the school admitted around 220 more students. </p>
<p>
     The eight campuses making up the Ivy League, as well as a number of other highly selective colleges, notified applicants Thursday evening of who secured a slot for the coming fall&apos;s first-year class. </p>
<p>
     This is a challenging period for colleges, as the coronavirus pandemic has scrambled enrollment projections for their next classes. It is unclear how many students will be able to travel for the start of the next academic year, if residence halls will be back open, and whether families can afford tuition payments amid rapidly deteriorating economic conditions. </p>
<p>
     Some schools moved students over to the admit pile from the wait list or &quot;deny&quot; group at the last minute, to help ensure they can enroll a full class. Reed College in Oregon boosted its admit rate by 3 percentage points, to 40%, while Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Pennsylvania accepted 32% of applicants this year, up by two points. </p>
<p>
     Acceptance rates can continue to shift as schools turn to their wait lists to round out their classes, so numbers aren&apos;t considered final until the start of the school year. </p>
<p>
     The uptick in acceptance rates at many exclusive schools reverses a yearslong trend that had generated a frenzy of competition -- and scrutiny over just how each coveted entry ticket is awarded. A 2018 civil trial laid bare Harvard&apos;s admission practices, including the high offer rates for legacies, certain racial minorities and recruited athletes. And the Varsity Blues college-admissions scandal, which ensnared colleges including Yale University, heightened skepticism over whether the admissions process is truly meritocratic. </p>
<p>
     Yale&apos;s acceptance rate edged up to 6.5% from 6.2% as that school continues to grow its undergraduate student body, and University of Pennsylvania&apos;s acceptance rate rose to 8.1% from 7.7%. </p>
<p>
     Brown University and Princeton University both posted drops in their admission rates: Brown slid to 6.9% from 7.1% last year, and Princeton edged down to 5.6% from 5.8%. </p>
<p>
     Cornell University this year said it would no longer issue public statements highlighting its admission figures. Stanford University took that tack beginning two years ago, saying at the time that it hoped &quot;to help de-emphasize the perceived importance of low admit rates at colleges and universities.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;While metrics such as application numbers and admissions rates are an area of focus for many as they review annual activity in higher education, Cornell&apos;s thorough and holistic review processes mean that no one applicant&apos;s chances can be guided by &apos;averages,&apos;&quot; said Jonathan Burdick, vice president for enrollment. </p>
<p>
     Cornell&apos;s move comes amid a growing push to highlight metrics of a school&apos;s quality beyond exclusivity, like student diversity, retention and graduation rates and job prospects. </p>
<p>
     The class that will enter these storied institutions in the fall looks remarkably different from what the schools had just a decade or two ago, in terms of racial diversity, their families&apos; educational backgrounds and socioeconomic status. At Harvard, roughly 23% of new students&apos; families have annual incomes below $65,000, and Penn said 15% of its new admits are first-generation college students. </p>

Nancy Pelosi&apos;s Lobbying Ban in Stimulus Package Quickly Nixed by K Street and Senate -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Gabriel T. Rubin </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     NANCY PELOSI TRIED TO BAN LOBBYING by firms that receive funds as part of the coronavirus stimulus package, but the provision tucked into page 728 of House Democrats&apos; draft proposal quickly caught the eye of lobbyists who were assured by Hill contacts that the provision had no chance of being included in the final legislation hammered out by the Senate. &quot;The corporation may not carry out any Federal lobbying activities,&quot; the House draft said. </p>
<p>
     It was one of several conditions on federal aid to corporations in Pelosi&apos;s bill. Others included bans on stock buybacks, restrictions on executive pay and a ban on paying dividends to shareholders until the federal assistance was fully repaid. Some of those corporate-accountability conditions were ultimately included in the Senate legislation. </p>
<p>
     Some legal experts saw the lobbying provision as a Democratic messaging effort that wouldn&apos;t have survived legal scrutiny. &quot;It&apos;s highly likely to be struck down as unconstitutional under the &apos;unconstitutional conditions&apos; doctrine,&quot; because it violates corporations&apos; First Amendment rights to petition the government, said Robert Kelner, a partner at Covington &amp; Burling who advises companies on lobbying-disclosure rules. </p>
<p>
     Lobbying by firms that receive bailout money was controversial during the financial crisis, too, and had uneven outcomes: Major banks continued to employ lobbyists, while American International Group took a yearslong break from lobbying after feeling pressure from Congress. It restarted in 2014 after it had repaid its $182 billion bailout. </p>
<p>
     BILL HAGERTY , the former ambassador to Japan now running for Senate in Tennessee, is following President Trump&apos;s lead and referring to the coronavirus as the &quot;Wuhan coronavirus&quot; or the &quot;foreign virus,&quot; terms rejected by public health experts like Anthony Fauci. The Republican Hagerty was supposed to hold a telephone town hall meeting on Wednesday with White House adviser Larry Kudlow, and the event&apos;s press release referred to the &quot;Wuhan coronavirus&quot; numerous times in quotes from Hagerty and Kudlow. The event was postponed. Hagerty has ratcheted up his anti-China rhetoric since leaving Japan, including writing a Breitbart op-ed last week blaming China for the virus&apos;s spread. </p>
<p>
     Trump says terms like &quot;Chinese virus&quot; aren&apos;t racist, but told Fox News on Tuesday that he would stop saying it: &quot;I decided we shouldn&apos;t make any more of a big deal out of it.&quot; Trump has taken issue with some Chinese government attempts to blame the U.S. military for the virus, which experts agree began its spread in Wuhan. Hagerty told the Journal that he believes the Chinese government was to blame for the crisis, and that the U.S. &quot;cannot allow them to rewrite history by deflecting blame for this deadly illness.&quot; His former employer seems to agree: the State Department scuttled a G-7 joint statement because it didn&apos;t call the coronavirus the &quot;Wuhan Virus.&quot; </p>
<p>
     DEFICIT CONCERNS have been thrown out the window in a time of crisis, and proponents of larger government programs feel vindicated. &quot;It&apos;s actually a fascinating progressive moment, because what it&apos;s shown is that all of these issues have never been about how are you going to pay for it,&quot; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on a Bernie Sanders campaign livestream. Stephanie Kelton, a Sanders-backing economist, says there are plenty of other major programs that could be pursued without spending offsets, including canceling medical debt. </p>
<p>
     Fiscal conservatives say that current economic conditions are exceptional and akin to wartime, so normal spending rules don&apos;t apply. &quot;Larger deficits are not only an inevitability, but are, unfortunately, a necessity,&quot; the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said. </p>
<p>
     CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT becomes a casualty of the pandemic. The House Judiciary Committee canceled a March 31 hearing with Attorney General Bill Barr. That hearing would have been Congress&apos;s first chance to question him about the handling of Trump associate Roger Stone&apos;s sentencing, which prompted all of the front-line Justice Department prosecutors to resign from the case. Many in Congress worry that oversight of the Trump administration&apos;s coronavirus response will be impeded by social-distancing measures that could keep Congress out of session. </p>
<p>
     RETAIL SECTOR expects large, but uneven, contraction. While some large retailers look for more workers to keep up with the demand for household essentials, the sector as a whole expects sales to plummet by around 30% a month as the pandemic continues, National Retail Federation chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said. Fiscal stimulus from Washington will be &quot;critical not only for keeping [workers] alive, but also retailers,&quot; he said on a call with the National Association of Business Economists. </p>
<p>
     CORONAVIRUS ATTACK ADS from Democratic groups debut against senators accused of selling stocks ahead of the market&apos;s steep decline. Majority Forward is running spots in Georgia attacking the state&apos;s GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, both up for election this year. Both have denied allegations that they profited from information about the virus&apos;s expected damage by selling stocks after they received a briefing from health officials. Republicans see the threat of coronavirus-related ads: a pro-Trump Super PAC has sent cease-and-desist letters to TV stations in swing states to try to block them from airing ads about Trump&apos;s response to the virus. </p>
<p>
     MINOR MEMOS: Sports betting site puts odds on Trump using words like &quot;tremendous&quot; and &quot;not our fault&quot; in coronavirus daily press briefings.... New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo appears on his brother Chris&apos;s CNN show, says &quot;Mom told me I had to.&quot;... Senators struggle with work from home, too: Illinois&apos;s Tammy Duckworth forgets to mute conference call with Democratic Senate caucus, tells her toddler to &quot;go potty and wash your hands then mommy will come downstairs.&quot; </p>

Sanders Backers Want Him to Stay in the Race -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Eliza Collins </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Bernie Sanders&apos;s supporters want him to stay in the presidential contest, despite an unlikely path to the Democratic nomination after a string of primary losses in March. </p>
<p>
     The Vermont senator would have to completely upend the race by capturing more than 60% of the remaining delegates to overtake former Vice President Joe Biden and earn the party&apos;s nomination to face President Trump in the November election. Mr. Biden&apos;s allies have called for unity, but Mr. Sanders has shown no sign of leaving the race and has deflected questions about how long he will continue competing against him. </p>
<p>
     In interviews with more than two dozen Sanders supporters, many of them acknowledged his second bid for the Democratic nomination was unlikely to be successful. But nearly all said they saw no reason for him to exit now, and most of those in states with primaries still to come said they planned to vote for the senator. </p>
<p>
     Backers said the coronavirus pandemic that has shut down much of the U.S. highlights the need for many of Mr. Sanders&apos;s signature issues, such as a Medicare for All health insurance program. They hope that his continued presence in the race will pressure the Democratic Party and Mr. Biden to adopt more of Mr. Sanders policies. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think he should not give up, even if it looks like he&apos;s not going to be the nominee. He needs to continue to advocate for what we believe in, &quot; said Luis Yofe, 67, who works in the travel industry and lives in Dallas. &quot;For us to be enthusiastic, Biden and the party will have to adopt, in the platform for the general election, some of the key principles that Bernie is advocating.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Biden has adopted some policies in a nod to liberals, including an expanded free-college program. Mr. Sanders has said the proposal doesn&apos;t go far enough. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I&apos;m happy to talk with him, and I&apos;ve indicated that I also hear his supporters,&quot; Mr. Biden said on ABC&apos;s &quot;The View&quot; this week. &quot;He&apos;s had very strong support from young people, and I hear them.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Democratic Party officials are set to meet in mid-July to decide on their platform and nominate the candidate who will take on Mr. Trump in the general election. To win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention, a candidate must earn 1,991 delegates, a majority of those awarded through state caucuses and primaries. As of Thursday afternoon, Mr. Biden had roughly 300 more delegates than Mr. Sanders. </p>
<p>
     But since the coronavirus crisis prompted some states to delay their contests, Mr. Biden is unlikely to sew up the nomination quickly if Mr. Sanders remains in the race. </p>
<p>
     In an interview with NPR Friday, Mr. Sanders said it would be &quot;a very steep road&quot; to overtake Mr. Biden. </p>
<p>
     The uncertainty caused by Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, has given some hope to a handful of Mr. Sanders&apos;s supporters that he still has a shot at the nomination. They say that the crisis has highlighted the need for a Medicare for All system because millions of people who lose their jobs because of the illness could also lose their health insurance. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think that the Covid stuff is maybe the absolute best possible thing for his campaign right now,&quot; said Kirsten Southwell, 29, a senior designer at the Art Institute of Chicago. &quot;I think it really confirms a lot of the things that Bernie has talked about.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ms. Southwell and others are hoping that voters will see Mr. Sanders&apos;s reaction to the crisis and go for him in droves, giving him the significant margins he would need in every state going forward. </p>
<p>
     &quot;More far-fetched or seemingly impossible scenarios have happened,&quot; said college student Brooke Britt, 21, who lives in Bristol, R.I., and plans to vote for Mr. Sanders in her state&apos;s primary, which has been postponed to June. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sanders returned to Vermont on Thursday after voting the night before on a roughly $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at bolstering the U.S. economy as it struggles with the spread of the coronavirus. Aides say the campaign&apos;s focus is on the day-to-day operation and responding to the pandemic rather than what Mr. Sanders&apos;s future holds. </p>
<p>
     The campaign hasn&apos;t put up a TV ad in more than a week and has stopped soliciting donations via email to fund its operation, instead pulling in money to support organizations that are involved in coronavirus relief. However, the campaign is still accepting donations on its website and recurring funds are still being pulled in. The Vermont senator is doing frequent virtual briefings, at times bringing on progressive lawmakers and activists. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sanders hasn&apos;t indicated any intention to quit the race. His spokesman said recently that he would participate in a presidential debate in April if the Democratic National Committee held one. </p>
<p>
     &quot;He is being extremely presidential and he&apos;s showing us exactly the way a leader would act in this moment,&quot; said Katherine Abegg, 43, a textile research and development manager who lives in Brooklyn. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Abegg wasn&apos;t alone in her passion for Mr. Sanders. Eleven of the 25 people interviewed by The Journal said they would have a difficult time voting for Mr. Biden in November and planned to write in a name at the top of their ballot, leave it blank or stay home on election day. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I don&apos;t want to show loyalty to a party that isn&apos;t showing loyalty to me,&quot; said Quentin Kanta, 20, a college student living in Monmouth, Ore. </p>
<p>
     Most of those who said they would not cast their ballots for Mr. Biden justified their position by saying they lived in states that were likely to vote for the Democrat anyway. However, Sanders supporters with whom the Journal spoke in Arizona, a 2020 battleground state, Idaho and Tennessee, both of which generally vote Republican, also said they wouldn&apos;t cast ballots for Mr. Biden. </p>
<p>
     An aide to Mr. Biden declined to comment beyond pointing to polling that shows the former vice president leading Mr. Trump in swing counties. </p>
<p>
     Just one of the Sanders supporters interviewed, 58-year-old Brenda Wilson of Cleveland, said Mr. Sanders should exit the race soon. Ms. Wilson said she is likely to cast her ballot for Mr. Biden when Ohio votes in June. &quot;I still love him,&quot; she said of Mr. Sanders, adding that if he remains in the race, he could hurt Mr. Biden&apos;s chances against Mr. Trump. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I&apos;m a true believer if there&apos;s a stronger candidate, we should go with you,&quot; she said. </p>

Virus Pushes Trump to a Rose Garden Campaign Strategy -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Gerald F. Seib </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Sometimes presidents choose to adopt a Rose Garden strategy to campaign for re-election, opting to make their case with the White House as a dramatic backdrop. </p>
<p>
     President Trump has adopted such a strategy because of the coronavirus, and he worked this week to make the most of it. Meanwhile, his real campaign is chugging along in virtual form below the radar screen. </p>
<p>
     Technically, Mr. Trump is using a pressroom strategy, because the White House briefing room rather than the Rose Garden just beyond its doors has become his forum for staying in front of voters. He now makes almost daily appearances there for a late-afternoon briefing and jousting session with White House reporters. </p>
<p>
     Other officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and government health experts, are on hand, too, but Mr. Trump is the clear star of the show. On Monday, his appearance stretched for almost two hours. </p>
<p>
     That has caused TV networks to debate whether to continue airing the briefings live. Meantime, the president stirred controversy this week by using that setting to argue for reopening the country&apos;s businesses sooner rather than later, sparking a backlash from experts who fear such a move is simply too risky. </p>
<p>
     Still, in political terms, the approach appears to be paying dividends. Mr. Trump&apos;s job-approval rating has ticked up in a series of polls. In the rolling Gallup survey, his weekly average has moved into positive territory with 49% approving of his performance while 45% disapprove. </p>
<p>
     Meantime, his campaign says it is utilizing digital tools to reach voters while much of the nation is shuttered. Between them, the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign say they have 550,000 trained volunteers. Last Saturday, the campaign says, supporters made 1.5 million calls from their homes to other voters, urging them to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for virus guidance -- while also touting Mr. Trump&apos;s record and urging supporters to register to vote online if they can. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Trump Campaign has a significant advantage because of our early and ongoing investment in data and technological infrastructure,&quot; asserts Ken Farnaso, deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign. </p>
<p>
     Former Vice President Joe Biden is reacting in kind, however. The presumptive Democratic nominee has geared up his own version of a Rose Garden strategy by setting up a mini TV studio in his Delaware home, from which he has delivered an online speech, held a conference call with reporters and conducted televised interviews. </p>

States Weigh Expansion of Vote-by-Mail -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Alexa Corse and Dustin Volz </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- States are exploring ways to expand voting by mail and early voting ahead of the November general election to make sure balloting proceeds if the coronavirus pandemic persists. </p>
<p>
     Election officials from state and local governments across the country held conference calls over the past week with the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies on the logistical, financial and legal obstacles to rolling out expanded vote-by-mail initiatives, according to people who participated in the calls. </p>
<p>
     A call last Friday featuring the U.S. Postal Service looked at the feasibility of implementing widespread mail voting, including the costs for mail-in ballot services and whether they could be reduced. Another call this week included the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess the coronavirus threat over the rest of the year. </p>
<p>
     Early voting and voting by mail have increased across the country over the past two decades. Election experts said the coronavirus pandemic could supercharge that trend, overhauling how elections are conducted and accelerating the shift away from voting in person at a local polling site on Election Day. </p>
<p>
     The massive relief package passed by Congress on Friday offers $400 million to the states for coronavirus contingencies involving elections, including voting by mail if states choose. Democrats had pushed to mandate vote-by-mail options in every state, but were rebuffed by Republicans, who said the matter should be left to the states. </p>
<p>
     State and federal officials said that rapidly moving to vote-by-mail systems within a matter of months poses formidable challenges, among them how to quickly print, process and count ballots and guard against tampering. </p>
<p>
     Giving all U.S. voters the option to vote by mail for the November general election could cost as much as $1.4 billion, generally on top of what states already spend, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a public-policy think tank. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s not necessarily possible for every jurisdiction in the country to ramp up to full vote by mail by November,&quot; said Ben Hovland, chairman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, a federal group that promotes best practices for elections, and one of the officials discussing options with states. &quot;I think it&apos;s fair for every jurisdiction to expect an increase in vote by mail in 2020, so we&apos;re having a lot of conversations about what they can do to prepare for that.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The discussions are taking place in part through communication channels the Department of Homeland Security set up with state officials after the 2016 election to confront cybersecurity threats to elections. The calls on voting options have been so popular that at least one exceeded capacity and some officials were unable to join, participants said. </p>
<p>
     In looking for voting alternatives, election officials are seeking advice from counterparts in Colorado, Washington and elsewhere that already rely heavily on mail-in voting. Colorado Director of Elections Judd Choate said last week that nearly a dozen states have contacted him asking for advice since the outbreak began. </p>
<p>
     All states allow some voters to cast mail ballots, but a third of states apply conditions for residents to use that method, such as being away on Election Day or having a disability. Some states conduct all-mail elections, though they generally also offer in-person voting and ballot drop-off sites. </p>
<p>
     The coronavirus has already caused some states to delay primary elections. Ohio ordered its polls not to open for its March 17 primary and state lawmakers passed a plan to extend voting by mail until April 28. </p>
<p>
     Coronavirus is now counted by state officials as an acceptable reason to vote by mail in West Virginia&apos;s May 12 primary. Maryland is conducting an April 28 special congressional election by mail to limit coronavirus exposure. Georgia&apos;s secretary of state said absentee-ballot request forms will be mailed to every registered voter ahead of the state&apos;s May 19 primary. Washington, D.C., said Friday it will encourage mail-in ballots for its June 2 primary. </p>
<p>
     Election officials need months to prepare options for the November vote, a date set by federal law, so they need to get contingencies under way. </p>
<p>
     Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said that while he is open to changes, a decision shouldn&apos;t be rushed. He said his concerns include logistics and protecting mail ballots from tampering. And, he said, there could be problems for voters who mail ballots or vote early, like some did for Democratic presidential candidates who then dropped out before primary day. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you want to have the safest election, you have people show up on election day,&quot; said Mr. Ashcroft, a Republican. </p>
<p>
     Others say voting by mail can pose other challenges, such as for voters with certain vision disabilities. </p>
<p>
     Casting ballots by smartphone or laptop is discouraged by cybersecurity experts as vulnerable to tampering. Voting by mail gained renewed attention as a reliable way to vote after the intelligence agencies&apos; assessment about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. </p>
<p>
     Vendors for mail-voting products said they have had a spike in queries, according to four companies in the business. </p>
<p>
     &quot;A lot of states are talking to us, a lot of counties are talking to us, &quot; said Jeff Ellington, president and chief operating officer of Runbeck Election Services Inc. The company offers mail-voting services including ballot printing and works with local governments in several states, including California, Arizona, Texas, Colorado, Utah and Florida. </p>
<p>
     Even those who support a rapid expansion of mail voting said scaling up wouldn&apos;t be easy, given the change can require different vote-counting machines such as specialized high-speed scanners and public awareness campaigns. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Our election infrastructure right now is not currently prepared for the dramatic increase in mail voting that we&apos;re going to have to anticipate and allow,&quot; said Wendy Weiser, head of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center. </p>

U.S.&apos;s Confirmed Cases Exceed 100,000 -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Infections continue to rise in New York and other hot spots across the country </p>
<pre>
By Talal Ansari, Lucy Craymer and Max Colchester </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     The U.S. surpassed 100,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus Friday, led by a continued jump in infections in New York and in new hot spots across the country. </p>
<p>
     While testing for the deadly respiratory virus hasn&apos;t been uniform across America or globally, making accurate case counts hard to pin down, confirmed infections in the U.S. have doubled or tripled every three days for nearly a month. </p>
<p>
     Last Friday, the number of confirmed infections in the country exceeded 16,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. By Tuesday, that figure was 55,000. Two days later, it had surpassed all other countries&apos; reported totals, with just over 85,000. </p>
<p>
     The pandemic has swiftly reverberated across the U.S., shutting schools, businesses, arenas and parks and silencing once-busy thoroughfares. A record 3.28 million workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. Hospital capacity in places like New York and Seattle has already passed a tipping point even as the health crisis continues to unfold. </p>
<p>
     President Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus bill passed speedily by House lawmakers earlier Friday, the largest economic-relief package in history. Major U.S. stock indexes posted double-digit gains for the week, but remain down more than 20% in 2020. </p>
<p>
     Authorities around the world have stepped up enforcement of measures designed to help slow the spread of the virus, which has now infected more than 590,000 people and killed nearly 27,000, according to Johns Hopkins data. </p>
<p>
     But national leaders continue to face risks even as they meet face-to-face in emergency sessions to plot ways to curb the contagion, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson testing positive for the virus Friday. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. and Italy have both now overtaken China as the nations with the most confirmed infections. Italy, which has the highest death toll of any country at 9,134, had nearly 86,500 confirmed infections; China, where the outbreak originated late last year, had 81,897. </p>
<p>
     The death toll in the U.S. stood at 1,581. </p>
<p>
     New York remains the center of the pandemic in the U.S., with more than 44,870 confirmed cases, but states including Michigan, Illinois, California and Louisiana are poised for a jump in cases as the rate of infection -- and of testing -- continues to grow. </p>
<p>
     U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said cities including Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans are expected to have a worse week next week. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The virus and the local community are going to determine the timeline. It&apos;s not going to be us from Washington, D.C.,&quot; Dr. Adams said on CBS on Friday. &quot;People need to follow their data. They need to make the right decisions based on what their data is telling them.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti warned residents on Thursday of the city&apos;s growing threat, telling residents that reports and images coming out of New York would likely be at their doorstep as early as next week. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s the most haunting images any leader could see, and it&apos;s difficult for me to imagine that it won&apos;t happen here,&quot; Mr. Garcetti said. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that crisis there is expected to peak in three weeks. Hospitals in New York City are already seeing massive rises in cases of patients with Covid-19, the pneumonialike disease caused by the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo, who has been pushing to increase hospital capacity by at least 50%, said four additional temporary hospitals would be built in the city, adding an additional 4,000 beds. </p>
<p>
     As the need for hospital equipment increases, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved the emergency use of devices that can be modified into ventilators. </p>
<p>
     Roughly 80% of Covid-19 cases tend to be mild or moderate, and more than 130,800 people globally have recovered. But those who are older or have underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, are at a higher risk. </p>
<p>
     In the U.K., Mr. Johnson, 55 years old, went into isolation after experiencing mild symptoms but would continue to lead Britain&apos;s response to the pandemic, officials said Friday. </p>
<p>
     His diagnosis raised concern that other senior officials could have been exposed to the virus, potentially amplifying the disruption the country faces. Hours after the announcement of the prime minister&apos;s infection, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, 41, said he had also tested positive and was isolated at home with mild symptoms. </p>
<p>
     Officials in Brazil, Iran and several other countries have also been infected. </p>
<p>
     In the past month, Mr. Johnson&apos;s government has advocated a strategy of &quot;herd immunity,&quot; avoiding stringent clampdowns on the British population. The government was forced to ditch that strategy last week when research by Imperial College showed the country&apos;s National Health Service would soon become overwhelmed. </p>
<p>
     Britain has reported more than 14,700 cases of coronavirus and 761 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins data. </p>
<p>
     Across the world, governments have closed schools, shut down nonessential services, told people to work from home and urged that they avoid going out as much as possible. Travelers arriving in many countries have also been subject to quarantines requiring them to remain in their homes, hotel rooms or government centers for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Some people who ignored the isolation and quarantine measures have been arrested, fined or charged with offenses. Chinese authorities on Thursday said they had indicted 18 people for defying contagious-disease control measures and had arrested an additional 14. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s tough approach to movement and social distancing has helped the country bring down infection rates significantly from the thousands of cases it reported daily in February. Chinese health authorities reported 55 new cases for Thursday; all but one were among people who were recently abroad. The country said a day earlier that it would close its borders to nearly all foreigners and drastically reduce international flights. </p>
<p>
     In Singapore -- where a second wave of coronavirus infections has brought the nation&apos;s total case count to 732, according to Johns Hopkins data -- authorities said people can be fined up to about $7,000 and jailed for up to six months if they don&apos;t comply with safe-distancing rules that went into effect Friday. </p>
<p>
     Hong Kong&apos;s secretary for security, John Lee, said 77 people had been caught violating mandatory self-quarantine, about 40 of them reported to authorities by family members and other citizens. The city&apos;s chief executive, Carrie Lam, announced new restrictions on social activities Friday, along with stiff penalties for violators. </p>
<p>
     Corrections &amp; Amplifications Australia reported 367 new coronavirus cases Friday, bringing the country&apos;s total to 3,166. An earlier version of this article incorrectly cited numbers for only a part of the country. (March 27, 2020) </p>

State&apos;s Jobless Surge Signals Wider Trouble -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Kris Maher and Eric Morath </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Pennsylvania, the nation&apos;s fifth-most populous state, recorded the largest number of unemployment claims in the U.S., an outsize spike that suggests other states could report higher numbers ahead. </p>
<p>
     Jobless claims in the keystone state rose to 378,908 last week, up from 15,439 the prior week, as the state&apos;s economy reels from layoffs due to the novel coronavirus. The number of people filing for benefits represented nearly 5.8% of the state&apos;s labor force. </p>
<p>
     State officials said jobless claims were so high was because they actively pushed workers to file for unemployment benefits and didn&apos;t see the kinds of disruptions in filing other states experienced. Workers in many parts of the country complained they were unable to access websites and get through on phone lines, meaning other states may be accepting a high volume of delayed filings in the coming weeks. Also, workers still have plenty of time to file such claims, meaning numbers could rise everywhere as economic prospects dim due to the pandemic. Workers aren&apos;t required to file for claims the week they are laid off. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think Pennsylvania is indicative of what you&apos;re going to see elsewhere,&quot; said James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse. &quot;I think you&apos;re going to see claims pick up in a lot of other states in the coming weeks, and that&apos;s pretty sobering considering the level we just saw.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Pennsylvania&apos;s numbers came out Thursday along with a record number of workers nationwide, nearly 3.3 million, filing for jobless benefits last week. </p>
<p>
     The state&apos;s experience suggests that the stresses facing the nation&apos;s unemployment system could grow in the months and weeks ahead, as other states catch up on processing claims and more workers pursue those benefits. </p>
<p>
     A spokeswoman with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry said the state system didn&apos;t suffer major disruptions like those reported in states like California and New York. The state also relaxed the requirement that the unemployed be actively seeking work to qualify for benefits. </p>
<p>
     Holly Chapman, 62, of Jefferson Hills, Pa., said she filed a claim online last Tuesday after being laid off from a catering company when a spate of weddings and other events were canceled. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I think because I was Johnny on the spot, it was relatively painless for me,&quot; she said. She added that co-workers who waited a couple of days encountered delays, but were eventually able to complete their claims. </p>
<p>
     There&apos;s also still plenty of time for workers to file claims. Some applying last week may have been laid off before the pandemic hit, but sought benefits as job prospects dimmed. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is more a question about why some other states don&apos;t have bigger numbers at this point,&quot; said Chris Briem, a regional economist at the University of Pittsburgh. &quot;In the short term, all these numbers have to go up.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Pennsylvania may have also had more claims because a larger share of its workforce was unemployed before the pandemic struck. The state unemployment rate in January was 4.7%, more than a percentage-point above the national average, ranking it 45th among states. Workers laid off earlier in the year for reasons unrelated to the virus can also apply for benefits, and maybe doing so now because many potential employers have closed. </p>
<p>
     Ohio had the second-highest number of claims with 187,784, narrowly ahead of California with 186,809. By contrast, in New York, which has nearly 7 million more residents than Pennsylvania, 80,334 workers, or about 0.8% of the labor force, filed for jobless benefits. </p>
<p>
     Most states provided an actual count of claims that they had received through Saturday. Ohio and Pennsylvania provided an estimated figure due to the large volume of claims they received, a U.S. Labor Department analyst said. Data for all states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio, are subject to revision in subsequent reports. State-level data tends to be volatile and is frequently revised. </p>
<p>
     Some in the state said Gov. Tom Wolf&apos;s decision to require broad closures of businesses considered non-life-sustaining contributed to the higher number of claims. </p>
<p>
     Thousands of businesses are still seeking waivers, saying they can operate safely by social distancing, said Gene Barr, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry. He said the group is trying to help reopen businesses that could aid with the response to the virus, like apparel manufacturers. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The governor is walking a fine line between trying to protect health and keep the economy going,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s no perfect bright line for that.&quot; </p>

OECD Warns on Growth Outlook -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Paul Hannon and Amara Omeokwe </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- Measures taken to curb the spread of the new coronavirus could lower economic activity in the U.S. and other developed countries by a quarter, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Friday. </p>
<p>
     In a report made available to leaders of the Group of 20 leading economies for a video conference they held Thursday, OECD economists estimated the likely impact on the sectors most affected by widespread business closures and orders for people to remain at home, and the size of those sectors in each national economy. </p>
<p>
     The OECD calculated that the activities most directly affected by the shutdowns -- ranging from restaurants to automobile makers -- account for between 30% and 40% of total output in most of the developed economies. With activity in many of those sectors curtailed, it calculated that output was likely to be between 20% and 25% lower than is usual in large, developed economies. </p>
<p>
     If the measures are sustained for three months, the OECD forecast total annual output would be 6% lower in the developed economies. Under this scenario for the U.S., where the economy was forecast to grow 2% this year before the virus struck, the OECD estimates output would fall 4% in 2020. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Our analysis further underpins the need for sharper action to absorb the shock, and a more coordinated response by governments to maintain a lifeline to people and a private sector that will emerge in a very fragile state when the health crisis is past,&quot; OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr&#237;a said in the report. </p>
<p>
     Signs already point to a deterioration in U.S. economic conditions during March, as the number of infections and deaths related to the virus climbed and multiple government authorities ordered nonessential businesses to close and urged people to stay home. A record 3.28 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits just last week, and forecasters now expect the unemployment rate to rise steeply. </p>
<p>
     The declines in other large economies would be similar to that in the U.S, according to the OECD. The organization&apos;s economists estimated that output losses would likely be greatest in Greece, which has a large tourism industry, and least in Ireland, which relies heavily on digital businesses. </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile in Italy, businesses and consumers became much more gloomy about their prospects this month, as the death toll from the coronavirus continued to climb and an already extensive lockdown tightened further. </p>
<p>
     Istat, the official Italian statistics agency, said Friday its measure of consumer confidence slumped to 101.0 from 110.9 in February as Italians saw a significant worsening of the economic outlook, while its measure of business confidence plummeted to 81.7 from 97.8. The turn to pessimism among companies was most marked among service providers, many of which have been almost entirely deprived of customers by social distancing. </p>
<p>
     The consumer confidence reading was the lowest since January 2015, while the business confidence measure was the weakest since December 2011. </p>
<p>
     Consumer sentiment also soured in the U.S. this month, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. </p>
<p>
     The survey&apos;s index of consumer sentiment fell to 89.1 in March -- its lowest level since 2016 -- down from 101.0 in February. </p>
<p>
     The index&apos;s drop -- the fourth-largest one-month decline in nearly 50 years -- hints at a broad pullback in spending as the virus upends daily life, said Richard Curtin, the survey&apos;s chief economist. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The extent of additional declines in April will depend on the success in curtailing the spread of the virus and how quickly households receive funds to relieve their financial hardships,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday he expects the economy to rebound strongly after the widespread shutdown to contain the coronavirus is lifted, adding that the federal government is working at &quot;lightning speed&quot; to provide support. </p>
<p>
     Asked if he agreed with some investors&apos; view that U.S. economic output could expand by 5% in the fourth quarter, Mr. Mnuchin said, &quot;Absolutely.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The House of Representatives was rushing Friday to form a quorum to pass a $2 trillion economic rescue package, which includes conditional grants for small businesses and aid to heavily affected industries such as airlines. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The sooner we can execute on this [rescue] package and the sooner we can win this war against the virus, the economy will bounce back very quickly,&quot; Mr. Mnuchin said on Fox Business. </p>
<p>
     Still, the decline in U.S. consumer sentiment data indicates how quickly economic conditions have changed as the virus&apos;s impacts have escalated. </p>
<p>
     Consumers just last month were still buoyed by a solid labor market and firming wages, and in turn boosted spending as personal income rose. </p>
<p>
     Personal-consumption expenditures, or household spending, ticked up by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% from January and personal income was up 0.6%, the Commerce Department reported Friday. </p>
<p>
     The rise in spending in February &quot;suggests coronavirus fears hadn&apos;t yet hit consumers, but it&apos;s pretty clear that spending has plunged in March as the domestic spread of the virus has accelerated,&quot; Andrew Hunter, senior economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients Friday. </p>

Nursing Home Visitor Ban Raises Difficult Questions -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Defining &apos;end of life&apos; to allow people to see dying loved ones is being widely debated </p>
<pre>
By Yuka Hayashi </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     When the U.S. government barred family members from visiting relatives in nursing homes, it made an exception for &quot;end of life situations&quot; -- setting off a painful, nationwide debate over the meaning of the phrase. </p>
<p>
     The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued the order on March 13 to protect nursing-home residents from the coronavirus after dozens of them died in facilities across the country. </p>
<p>
     Many families see the policy as a painful but necessary step to protect the elderly and ill. But it has been hardest on those who fear their loved ones have just days to live, say families and nursing home officials. </p>
<p>
     Some 1.4 million elderly and disabled adults live in more than 15,000 nursing homes, according to U.S. government data. Stanford Medical School estimates that about 20% of Americans end their days in nursing homes. </p>
<p>
     Sherry Culp, who works at the Nursing Home Ombudsman Agency of the Bluegrass in Kentucky, fields calls from patients and families and communicates their issues to facilities. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The biggest concern that we are hearing from family members is that they have a resident in a nursing home who they think is &apos;end of life,&apos; but they are having trouble accessing the resident for in-person visits, &quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There is some confusion about what is &apos;end of life,&apos;&quot; said Ms. Culp. </p>
<p>
     The government directive didn&apos;t define the phrase, and it left some delicate questions unanswered: How long before death should visits be allowed? How many relatives can visit? What safety procedures should be adopted to protect other residents? </p>
<p>
     Last week Ms. Culp got a call from an 86-year-old man who worried he would be turned away from the nursing home where his wife was receiving hospice care. Ms. Culp assured him he had the right to visit since his wife was dying. </p>
<p>
     Kentucky and some other states, responding to pleas from anguished families who wanted to visit dying relatives, have drawn up their own guidelines and definitions of end of life. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This includes any resident who is receiving hospice care, not just a resident who is facing imminent death,&quot; the Ohio Department of Health wrote in a memo to nursing home administrators last week. </p>
<p>
     That memo came too late for Joe Race, an Ohio trade association executive, whose 87-year-old mother, Bernadine Raicevich, was dying of ovarian cancer. </p>
<p>
     When her condition deteriorated earlier this month, Mr. Race called seven hospices. All said they would take her but that family members wouldn&apos;t be allowed to visit. </p>
<p>
     So he and his four siblings kept her home near Cleveland and took turns caring for her around the clock, even though they felt she would have benefited from professional palliative care. Mrs. Raicevich, a retired nurse, passed away peacefully Sunday, with one of her daughters by her side. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I want to be a team player, but I wish they had fewer restrictions for people at the end of their life,&quot; Mr. Race said. &quot;Take my temperature at the door, put me in hazmat clothing. I&apos;d gladly wear it and go see my mom,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s too much to ask.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement last week that families should be notified &quot;several days and up to one week in advance of&quot; a substantial change in a patient&apos;s condition, but didn&apos;t specify how that should be determined. &quot;Providers should not wait until active dying.&quot; </p>
<p>
     At Jordan Center in Louisa, Ky., nursing home officials called families of its nearly 100 residents to ask how they felt about the coming ban on visits. </p>
<p>
     All but five families said they were supportive. Two decided to take their residents home, and others initially refused to heed the ban, according to David McKenzie, Jordan Center&apos;s administrator. </p>
<p>
     Among them was an 82-year-old woman who visited her husband with dementia every day, arriving before breakfast and leaving after dinner. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It was heartbreaking,&quot; Mr. McKenzie said. &quot;I can&apos;t even imagine what it would be like to be separated from your spouse after being together for 67 years.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. McKenzie met with the woman twice and convinced her to accept the ban. She now talks to her husband via video calls. </p>
<p>
     Kathleen Heren, an ombudsman at the Alliance for Better Long-Term Care in Rhode Island, has to improvise when advising facilities because the state hasn&apos;t issued guidance. </p>
<p>
     She recommends that facilities have family members visit &quot;toward the end, &quot; when hospice nurses see signs of imminent death, rather than at the start of hospice care. Just one or two family members should be allowed in at any time, she said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s really a case of common sense,&quot; Ms. Heren said. &quot;There is no set answer to anything.&quot; </p>

Non-Coronavirus Drug Testing Is Interrupted -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jared S. Hopkins </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     The world-wide spread of the new coronavirus is throwing into disarray studies critical to the development of promising new medicines. </p>
<p>
     The pandemic is causing delays in starting clinical drug trials and temporarily halting others, according to companies, consultants and industry officials. Patients enrolled in some studies have stopped showing up at trial sites, while hospitals supposed to see trial subjects are shifting attention to tackling coronavirus patients. Industry scientists, meanwhile, can&apos;t travel for research. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Things are just getting canceled left and right,&quot; said Christian Burns, president of ClinEdge LLC, which helps drug companies recruit drug-trial participants in more than 30 countries. </p>
<p>
     The disruptions, which aren&apos;t affecting research into coronavirus drugs and vaccines, mean it could take longer for new drugs aimed at treating conditions like diabetes and liver disease to reach patients, if the medicines eventually prove to work safely. </p>
<p>
     Company revenue could suffer, too, if future sales of drugs are deferred because of trial delays. </p>
<p>
     The drug studies most affected are in heavy-hit regions, such as Italy, China and South Korea, where lockdowns have restricted the ability of patients to leave their homes, enroll in trials and travel to study sites to get experimental treatments, industry officials say. Studies in the U.S. are also starting to feel an impact. </p>
<p>
     Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said this week they will hold off starting most new trials, citing safety concerns. Bristol is also temporarily halting infusions of experimental cellular therapies under study, while Lilly said it will pause enrolling new study subjects for trials already under way. Pfizer Inc. said Wednesday it is suspending recruitment of patients for most new and ongoing studies that don&apos;t involve life-threatening conditions. </p>
<p>
     Trials play a pivotal role in the introduction of new medicines. Regulators rely on the results to gauge whether an experimental drug is safe and works, and should be approved for use. Companies can spend tens of millions of dollars to carry out a single study. </p>
<p>
     Many current drug trials for critical ailments are expected to continue, though, because hospitals and drugmakers view them as crucial for patients. Also, patients testing drugs for fatal or critical conditions such as cancer are motivated not to skip treatments. </p>
<p>
     The pandemic, though, threatens to delay research into much-needed treatments for other critical conditions. </p>
<p>
     Nearly two-thirds of 170 clinical trial sites surveyed in the U.S. believe patients will be much less or somewhat less likely to enroll in new clinical research trials due to the coronavirus, according to a review last week from consultancy Continuum Clinical. And nearly half the sites expect patients enrolled in trials to be much less or somewhat less willing to keep participating. </p>
<p>
     &quot;That&apos;s where this could be really damaging,&quot; said Continuum President Neil Weisman. &quot;If too many patients discontinue with a clinical trial, pharma companies aren&apos;t going to have enough data to prove their products hit an endpoint and show their drug does what they hope it would do.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Northwell Health system on Long Island, N.Y., has paused about 50 clinical trials to protect patients and free up more than 40 staffers for coronavirus drug research. &quot;Right now, I&apos;m prioritizing,&quot; said Kevin Tracey, president of Northwell&apos;s Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research. </p>
<p>
     Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is based in Pasadena, Calif., last week suspended enrollment in a liver-disease trial for at least four weeks because the study needs patients who are at risk for coronavirus infections and who must get a liver biopsy, which requires visiting a clinic, said Chief Executive Christopher Anzalone. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There&apos;s probably some type of disaster-planning going on in every single company,&quot; said Laurie Halloran, chief executive of Halloran Consulting Group, which advises firms on clinical trials. </p>
<p>
     To keep trials moving forward despite the virus, some drugmakers are trying to transfer to patients&apos; homes the work typically done at research sites. </p>
<p>
     Scynexis Inc., of Jersey City, N.J., is directing patients in a trial for its experimental fungal treatment to have blood drawn at home or alternative sites, and to receive the drug at home, after some patients missed appointments in Italy and other European countries, said Chief Executive Marco Taglietti. </p>
<p>
     When Chinese drugmaker BeiGene Ltd., which focuses on cancer treatments, saw that patients weren&apos;t visiting test sites and hospitals in China were turning their attention to coronavirus, the drugmaker increased remote-monitoring of patients, said Eric Hedrick, BeiGene&apos;s chief adviser. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. Food and Drug Administration provided guidance last week aimed at allowing trials to continue while ensuring patient safety. The agency recommended screening enrolled patients for the new coronavirus, while suggesting alternative ways for patients to access treatments </p>
<p>
     It also said it will allow trial procedures that typically need approvals by the FDA or trial safety boards to proceed as long as they are reported afterward. </p>

MIT Launches Tracking Project -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Douglas Belkin and Kirsten Grind </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     A project to track Covid-19 patients via their phones is being launched by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers, potentially the first large-scale project in the U.S. to trace their movement and those with whom they interact. </p>
<p>
     The project requires both people who have the illness caused by the novel coronavirus and those who don&apos;t to voluntarily download an app to their phones. The collected data is scrambled so that individuals can&apos;t be identified, the researchers said. </p>
<p>
     Such measures are aimed at alleviating the privacy concerns that in the U.S. have surrounded the prospect of this type of surveillance, the researchers said. Amid the pandemic, location tracking is increasingly common in other parts of the world where there are fewer protections for civil liberties. </p>
<p>
     The researchers said they are in negotiations for backing from the World Health Organization about how the technology should be deployed. They also are working with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and have had several conversations with the White House, according to people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>
     Representatives for those agencies didn&apos;t respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>
     Health officials and scientists have increasingly realized that more testing and so-called contact tracing -- figuring out how to track people who have come in contact with the virus -- is the key to stopping its rapid spread. In South Korea and China, governments used tracking devices for surveillance of citizens, a move that helped those countries identify and treat patients. </p>
<p>
     Privacy advocates in the U.S. have said the pandemic calls for extraordinary measures but worry that once adopted, surveillance technologies will be hard to roll back. </p>
<p>
     The MIT project&apos;s success is dependent on amassing a large number of participants, and whether that is attainable in the U.S. isn&apos;t yet clear. </p>
<p>
     The MIT research group says it is also joining with big tech companies and large health-care systems, such as the Mayo Clinic and the Big Four accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young to aggregate as much data as possible through the app, called Private Kit. Several Facebook engineers are donating their time to the project, which is led by Ramesh Raskar, a former Facebook Inc. executive who also worked at Alphabet Inc.&apos;s Google X unit. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Stopping epidemics is a game of numbers. It&apos;s not about getting everybody or nobody (quarantined),&quot; said Dr. Raskar, who has a doctorate in computer science. &quot;The models show that even at 10% there will be gains.&quot; He also said it is critical to develop contact-tracing strategies in locations before the virus takes hold. </p>
<p>
     &quot;In New York, it&apos;s probably too late,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     The MIT effort comes as a host of startups and researchers are racing to develop new technology to fight various aspects of the novel coronavirus. Few have gained significant traction thus far. </p>
<p>
     The Wall Street Journal reported last week about various proposals that have been considered, including the use of facial technology to identify people who have come in contact with patients with Covid-19. </p>
<p>
     Facebook and Google are among the companies that have cooperated with a White House task force that is looking at technologies such as location tracking. The companies have said they are working with the government to develop solutions to help mitigate the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Right now in the U.S., when individuals are diagnosed with Covid-19 they are interviewed by public health officials and asked whom they have come in contact with over the last several days. Those people are then reached by phone. This process can take several days for each individual. </p>
<p>
     The lack of testing and visibility into who is infected has prompted widespread shutdowns of schools and businesses, with massive economic ramifications. The broad dissemination of the app could lead to a more selective set of closings, said Dr. Suraj Kapa, cardiologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who worked on the project. </p>
<p>
     If this works, you can create &quot;a much more curated lockdown to include very specific places of business and very specific areas to reduce the economic impact, instead of locking down everything,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     The tracking technologies that have been effective in some countries can&apos;t be used in democracies without major privacy concerns, a major hurdle for tech companies trying to solve the problem. One of the biggest issues is that location tracking is often done without the user&apos;s knowledge or explicit permission. </p>
<p>
     MIT researchers and their partners say the new technology addresses those concerns by anonymizing the data of each individual who signs up for the system and asking users to self-report. Users also have the option of editing their data before they submit it. The governments of Brazil and Taiwan are using similar models. </p>
<p>
     &quot;A user never has to share their information with the government&quot; or any other third party like a tech company, Dr. Raskar said. </p>
<p>
     The location of people diagnosed with Covid-19 would be downloaded by public health officials and government agencies, although they wouldn&apos;t be able to see any identifying information. </p>
<p>
     The Private Kit app asks both people confirmed to have Covid-19 and those who aren&apos;t infected, to upload their recent travel from Google location services on their phone. Once new users join, they will be required to start logging their locations and can also view &quot;hot spots&quot; from other aggregated data that has been uploaded to the app. </p>
<p>
     The app notifies users if they are near someone who has been infected. </p>
<p>
     Where the anonymized data would actually be stored isn&apos;t clear; researchers say they are working with local governments to store the data on their servers. </p>
<p>
     Governments accessing any kind of location data, whether anonymized or not, is always a privacy risk, even though health officials need it during a crisis, says Albert Gidari, the consulting director of privacy at Stanford Law School&apos;s Center for Internet and Society. </p>
<p>
     &quot;At the end of the day, there&apos;s always a risk of misuse of the data,&quot; Mr. Gidari says. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Gidari pointed out that Israel, which has come under fire by privacy critics over some of its surveillance technology, also recently launched an opt-in location-tracking app for citizens called &quot;The Shield.&quot; </p>

Fed Weighs Support for States -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Local governments are confronting skyrocketing borrowing costs </p>
<pre>
By Nick Timiraos and Heather Gillers </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Federal Reserve officials are reviewing new ways to support financing for state and local governments, many of which are on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic and will face huge borrowing needs as revenues plunge, according to people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>
     The economic-rescue legislation Congress approved this week asks the Fed to charge headlong into areas it has long considered taboo -- supporting lending to businesses, cities and states. The Fed traditionally avoided intervening directly in credit and fiscal policy, preferring to leave such matters to Congress and the White House. </p>
<p>
     That is changing now because of the fast-moving economic crisis -- and because Congress has essentially directed the Fed to get more involved by providing $454 billion to the Treasury to cover any losses in new Fed lending programs. </p>
<p>
     The Fed has dramatically expanded its balance sheet over the past two weeks, by nearly $942 billion to $5.25 trillion as of Wednesday. The central bank has lent freely to help firms avoid a wave of defaults that could turn a recession into something much worse. </p>
<p>
     Over two weeks, the Fed has unveiled six lending facilities, five of them enjoying a total of $50 billion in support from the Treasury. Those programs have freed up cash for major Wall Street institutions and will backstop money-market fu nds and markets for commercial debt. </p>
<p>
     Democratic lawmakers have made support for city and state borrowing a priority in recent legislative talks, and the latest bill directs the Treasury secretary to seek a Fed lending program for municipal finance. </p>
<p>
     State and local governments are confronting skyrocketing borrowing costs even as they are straining to pay expenses associated with the spread of the virus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last week &quot;to think big and help our states,&quot; she said in an interview on PBS this week. &quot;They are taking a big bite of this wormy apple and they need much more in terms of resources.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Under its governing law, the Fed can&apos;t directly buy corporate debt, and it is limited to purchasing municipal debt of six months or less. But it can work around these restrictions by creating lending facilities that lend or purchase debt, subject to approval of the Treasury secretary. </p>
<p>
     The Fed has already dipped a toe into muni-debt markets by expanding a money-market lending backstop to include certain types of municipal debt -- and by purchasing some highly rated municipal debt in a facility backing the market for very short-term commercial debt. </p>
<p>
     As of Wednesday, short-term interest costs on variable-rate municipal bonds have more than tripled compared with two weeks ago and are now higher than the rates governments typically pay on 30-year bonds, according to an index maintained by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. </p>
<p>
     Monday&apos;s announcement by the Fed to include more municipal debt in existing lending facilities appears to have made only a small dent, bringing the index, which tracks bonds that adjust their rates weekly according to what investors are willing to pay, to 4.7% down from 5.2% the prior Wednesday. </p>
<p>
     Interest rates on other short-term muni debt that spiked last week have fallen after the Fed said Monday it would purchase some municipal variable rate debt. Rates on water, power and sewer bonds issued by New York City and Los Angeles fell back to their typical rates of between 1% and 2% Thursday after hitting nearly 8% on Friday. </p>
<p>
     Kent Hiteshew, who established an office of state and local finance at the Treasury Department in the Obama administration, has been hired by the Fed for a six-month appointment to advise on muni markets, according to people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>
     Among the questions Fed officials are considering: Whether to expand existing facilities to accommodate other municipal debt or to launch a new facility devoted to state and local finance. Fed officials will have to decide which municipal debt might be eligible for support and on what terms. </p>
<p>
     There are limits to how far the Fed can lend using its emergency authorities. Its loans must be well secured, which the Fed typically satisfies by restricting borrowing to highly-rated issuers. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The states and localities that need the most help are the most risky by definition,&quot; said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI, an investment research firm, who previously worked in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. </p>
<p>
     The Fed and Treasury brainstormed ways to support hard-hit state and local treasuries after the 2008 financial crisis, but opted against doing so. </p>
<p>
     Governments have been canceling almost all planned long-term muni deals, borrowing they typically rely on for infrastructure needs and budget management, after investors fled muni mutual funds last week and prices plummeted. There was $761.7 million in total muni issuance last week, according to Refinitiv, compared to around $8 billion during a typical week earlier in the year. </p>
<p>
     Government borrowers include states facing high Medicaid costs, delayed income tax collections and huge drop-offs in sales taxes as commerce has slowed to a standstill -- and municipalities that run hospital systems, nursing homes, jails and public-health departments. </p>
<p>
     &quot;As our borrowing costs go up, that&apos;s fewer dollars they have to allocate to the crisis,&quot; said Matthew Chase, executive director of the National Association of Counties. </p>
<p>
     Fed officials have long had broader philosophical objections to intervening in financial affairs of subnational entities. The central bank is the fiscal agent of the federal government, and they have viewed state and local finance as the domain of Congress and the Treasury Department. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Fed&apos;s response has typically been, &apos;Look, if the federal government wants to support state and local finance, they can do that directly,&quot; said Lewis Alexander, who served as an economic adviser at the Treasury Department from 2009-11 and is now chief U.S. economist at Nomura Securities. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There is a real reluctance to blur the line between the federal government and the state and locals. You start going down that road, it&apos;s hard to know where to stop.&quot; </p>

Tariff Collections to Be Paused, Officials Say -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Alex Leary and William Mauldin </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is preparing to suspend collection of import tariffs for three months to give U.S. companies financial relief amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to administration officials. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Customs duties will be suspended for three months,&quot; a senior administration official said Friday. </p>
<p>
     Companies would still be liable for the tariffs at a later date, which hasn&apos;t been determined, another official said. There would be no formal changes to tariff policy, officials said. </p>
<p>
     Asked about The Wall Street Journal&apos;s report at a news briefing late Friday, Mr. Trump called the report &quot;fake news.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump signed a roughly $2 trillion economic-stimulus bill Friday as the economy has been brought to a standstill by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Business groups have called for tariff relief. They have faced resistance from trade hawks and domestic industries such as steel calling for protection from what they see as unfairly traded imports. </p>
<p>
     U.S. Customs and Border Protection in recent days sent out a formal notice saying it would provide temporary delays for customs duties on a case-by-case-basis, only to rescind the offer on Thursday. </p>
<p>
     Even so, the administration officials said the White House was now moving to stop the collection of tariffs, while leaving the tariffs in place. </p>
<p>
     A spokesman for Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, didn&apos;t immediately reply to a request for comment. </p>
<p>
     The plans for tariff-payment delays doesn&apos;t by itself mean the administration is backing away from the use of trade barriers to defend domestic industry. Trade experts say the combination of the 2020 presidential election and a possible recession suggests the administration would face a political backlash if it removed the tariffs, including in manufacturing-heavy states of the Midwest. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This whole crisis is a vindication of President Trump&apos;s tariff policies, which over the last three years have already begun to bring some of our supply chains and jobs home,&quot; White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro told the Journal last week. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, Mr. Navarro was appointed by Mr. Trump to oversee government efforts to arrange private production of essential items during the pandemic. Mr. Navarro couldn&apos;t immediately be reached by phone Friday. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump has imposed global tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as well as tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in a trade war sparked off by China&apos;s treatment of American intellectual property and trade secrets. </p>
<p>
     Other imports also face duties based on findings of foreign &quot;dumping&quot; or subsidies, and the U.S. maintains usually low tariffs on a host of products from most countries under international agreements. </p>
<p>
     Washington and Beijing in January signed a &quot;phase one&quot; agreement that serves as a truce in the trade war. The U.S. didn&apos;t remove tariffs on any Chinese products under that pact, they only reduced the rates of some tariffs. </p>
<p>
     The pact requires China to buy $200 billion more in U.S. exports than it previously did, and Mr. Trump has said he expects the pact to be upheld. </p>
<p>
     The two countries have recently seen tensions grow over the virus, which spread from China, as well as a spat that has seen both nations reduce the number of foreign correspondents permitted from the other country. </p>

EPA Delays Switchover From Winter to Summer Fuel -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Timothy Puko </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency is delaying the changeover to summer gasoline by several weeks, saying otherwise the coronavirus pandemic could cause a fuel shortage. </p>
<p>
     Lobbyists have described this as possibly the biggest of several waivers the Trump administration is giving to industry and water authorities while they keep many workers at home to slow the pandemic&apos;s spread.  The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that such a move was likely. </p>
<p>
     The EPA said Friday it will waive requirements to sell the cleaner fuel until May 20, giving wholesalers and refiners at least about three extra weeks to sell off a backlog of the winter blend. The action delays an annual switch in the spring to cleaner-burning blends of gasoline designed to keep air pollution levels from rising sharply in hotter, sunnier months. </p>
<p>
     The action drew objections from the environmental group Defend Our Future, an arm of the Environmental Defense Fund, which said it will weaken public health protections at a time when air pollution may make people more vulnerable to the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This decision could lead to more pollution and worse air quality, which will jeopardize human lives,&quot; the group&apos;s Matt Oberhoffner said in a statement. </p>
<p>
     States make the transition to summer gasoline between April 1 and May 1, and several had already asked the EPA to step in for clarity across the country, said Tom Kloza, the top analyst at IHS Markit Ltd.&apos;s Oil Price Information Service. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Kloza expects that with travel limited by the pandemic April gasoline demand will drop to levels unseen since the 1960s, off seasonal norms by more than 40%. </p>
<p>
     The EPA says that if distributors aren&apos;t able to sell off the backlog of winter gas in their storage tanks, they won&apos;t be able to start putting summer gasoline into them, blocking supply of the cleaner fuel from the market. </p>
<p>
     In the same announcement, the  EPA also said it intends to extend ethanol-blending compliance deadlines for small refineries, and won&apos;t revisit prior exemptions given to them that were brought into question by a recent court ruling. It says it is prioritizing rules connected to potentially acute risks and imminent threats during the pandemic and calls revisiting these ethanol exemptions for small refiners a low priority. </p>

Hair Stylist&apos;s Survival Plan Is to Build a Digital Salon -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Steven Russolillo | Photographs by Hannah Yoon for The Wall Street Journal </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Maddisen Maxwell&apos;s Highland Park, N.J., hair salon has seen tough times. Michael B Hair &amp; Style opened its doors in December 2008, during the throes of the Great Recession. A van rammed into the storefront years later, prompting it to close for months while repairs took place. </p>
<p>
     Turmoil created by the coronavirus pandemic is more stressful than those early trials. Tough as it is, the 41-year-old stylist can&apos;t let it sink her business. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Obviously we can&apos;t do hair virtually,&quot; Ms. Maxwell said by phone earlier this week. &quot;But we&apos;re trying to find what aspects of our brick-and-mortar business we can take online.&quot; After years of thinking about ways to branch out into digital services, the crisis is forcing her hand. </p>
<p>
     On Thursday, a week after closing the salon as cancellations had been piling up, she turned it into a studio. She used a gray screen, lights and an iPhone camera to shoot a video tutorial on washing and maintaining curly hair. She performed on a mannequin to adhere to social-distancing norms. </p>
<p>
     A hair stylist for over 20 years, Ms. Maxwell is hopeful her online offerings will meet enough demand to supplement at least some of the lost revenue that can come from a $60 blowout and style or a $300 weave during normal times. A majority of her clients are African-Americans who she says rely on getting their hair styled professionally as opposed to doing it themselves. She hopes e-consultations can help. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They&apos;re really struggling trying to figure out what to do,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Maxwell started sensing a few weeks ago there would be demand for services outside the salon. Before the pandemic worsened, some women were asking her to do home visits. Last week, New Jersey said salons needed to temporarily close to help prevent the virus from spreading. </p>
<p>
     Yet clients still need their hair done. Based on feedback from clients, she intends to offer half-hour FaceTime consultations for $50 to those who want help while coloring or styling their hair from home. </p>
<p>
     In addition, she is packaging and selling products like shampoo and moisture masks in what she is branding as beauty boxes that go for as much as $150. Shortly after launching the boxes she sold three of them. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Maxwell still has a lot of headaches to sort out. Her four employees, for example, remain on the salon&apos;s books and she hopes to keep paying them with government stimulus money. </p>
<p>
     Even with the innovation and government help, her business needs to make drastic changes. She plans to eventually cancel the salon&apos;s current lease, saving $4,000 a month that had been going toward rent. She is merging with her sister&apos;s salon a few towns away. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It was the only way for us to keep moving forward,&quot; she said. If she had tried to maintain the status quo for a few more weeks, Michael B Hair &amp; Style would have gone out of business. &quot;This at least lets me continue.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ms. Maxwell and her husband, Dalles, are co-owners of the salon, and have three children at home. Mr. Maxwell&apos;s mother and aunt, both retired teachers, are helping their three children -- ages 7, 10 and 17 -- with distance learning at home. That has freed Mr. Maxwell to focus on a few side gigs to keep bills paid while the salon is closed. </p>
<p>
     He has been working with a meal-prep startup focused on healthy eating. And a carpenter on the side, he recently started a contracting business with a few kitchen and bathroom projects for friends and neighbors who allowed him in their homes despite concerns over coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I wanted to start it for years. Now it&apos;s in high gear,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m starting with small projects, that&apos;s getting some money coming in.&quot; </p>

A Postman Works to Complete His Appointed Rounds -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By John D. Stoll </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 17, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Dik LaPine has been a postman in Duluth, Minn., for 21 years and prides himself on rarely missing shifts. The 62-year-old carrier&apos;s six-hour route has him stopping into many Duluth businesses and a smattering of homes every day. </p>
<p>
     On Monday, as concerns continued to rise about the spread of the new coronavirus, Mr. LaPine clocked in at about 7 a.m. to prepare his deliveries to banks, real-estate agencies, nail salons, bars and restaurants. The local shopping mall is also on his list. </p>
<p>
     The initial delivery, usually made around 9 a.m., is to a woman long confined to her home. After that, a toy shop, a furniture store and apartment buildings get visits. &quot;I see a hundred people a day,&quot; he said this weekend. &quot;I bump into people who have colds and people who want to touch me and I go, &apos;No no no, we gotta kick feet or something else.&apos;&quot; </p>
<p>
     This is uncomfortable for Mr. LaPine, a former school teacher and minister with close relationships to many people on his route. The U.S. Postal Service has issued gloves, masks and hand sanitizer to carriers in Duluth as they prepare to venture out. </p>
<p>
     Mr. LaPine washes his hands dozens of times a day in sinks all over the city, including rest rooms in office complexes, a Firestone tire shop and a chiropractor. He also constantly applies sanitizer. He doesn&apos;t wear gloves because they are harder to keep clean. If he and colleagues were offered testing, he would volunteer to be consistently screened, he said. </p>
<p>
     For now, postal workers are being encouraged to stay home if they are experiencing any symptoms. Last week, there was one day on which 12 in Duluth stayed home. &quot;The Post Office doesn&apos;t want us to work through this as carriers of anything but mail,&quot; Mr. LaPine said. He said he feels fine now, but worries his age makes him more vulnerable to severe illness. &quot;It would probably kill me if I get it, who knows,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. LaPine is a cartoonist in his spare time. &quot;If I did get quarantined, I&apos;d be in heaven,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d spend my time drawing.&quot; He has recently started work illustrating a children&apos;s book his sister wrote. </p>
<p>
     He frets about spreading the virus to his three grandchildren, who spend every Friday at his house in Superior, Wis., which is connected to Duluth by bridges. Mr. LaPine&apos;s wife has encouraged him to suspend his daily routine of ordering a lunch of two pieces of chicken, coleslaw and Hawaiian rolls with butter at the Super One grocery store, but Mr. LaPine said it will be tough following his wife&apos;s guidance. &quot;They have the best chicken,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Postal workers in Duluth are used to threats. It&apos;s not uncommon to run into black bears, for instance. What is Mr. LaPine truly afraid of? &quot;Pit bulls,&quot; he said. He has had close encounters with dogs (his only bite came from a cocker spaniel), and he knows fellow carriers who have been mauled. </p>
<p>
     Mr. LaPine recalls that mail delivery kept up in past crises, such as the 2001 anthrax scare, which came early in his career. &quot;We were constantly keeping an eye out for white powder,&quot; he said. At that time, carriers religiously wore gloves. </p>
<p>
     The Post Office is mandating overtime for those who can take on extra work. Mr. LaPine doesn&apos;t typically take overtime and said the extra load could run him down when concerns about healthy living are high. </p>
<p>
     But, he adds, he may not have a choice. &quot;We are shorthanded all the time now,&quot; he said. </p>

U.S. Eases Curbs on Seasonal Labor Visas -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Michelle Hackman </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- The State Department is further easing requirements on seasonal foreign worker visas, following agriculture industry warnings that a bottleneck created by coronavirus-related curbs could prompt a farm-labor shortage at the peak of spring harvest. </p>
<p>
     Under the latest rules, which the State Department issued Thursday, most applicants will no longer need an in-person interview to get visas for farm or other seasonal work, such as landscaping, fishing or working at resorts. That requirement had slowed the number of workers entering the U.S. The State Department paused most visa processing in embassies and consulates abroad due to the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Under a different set of rules issued last week, only returning workers -- nearly all of whom come from Mexico -- were allowed to skip the interview. </p>
<p>
     Though the new rules apply to all seasonal workers, most of those entering the country at the moment are coming to plant and harvest crops. U.S. farmers rely heavily on the seasonal guest-worker visas, known as H-2A, which can legally account for as many as one in 10 of a farm&apos;s workers. </p>
<p>
     The industry pressed the Trump administration, particularly Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who is an ally of the visa program, to ease requirements. </p>
<p>
     &quot;American farmers are dependent on guest workers from the H-2A program to harvest our crops, and American consumers are dependent on the food from these harvests for continued sustenance during the present crisis,&quot; said Dave Puglia, president of Western Growers, in a statement. </p>
<p>
     The action runs counter to most steps the Trump administration has taken to cut off most access to the legal immigration system, including shuttering immigration offices in the U.S. The H-2A program has grown rapidly through both the Obama and Trump administrations, doubling in the past decade to more than 200,000 workers last year. </p>
<p>
     The easing of H-2A curbs has angered groups advocating tighter restrictions on immigration -- some of President Trump&apos;s staunchest allies -- who say the government shouldn&apos;t be making it easy for employers to hire foreign labor when so many Americans are losing their jobs. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The dependence on foreign labor to produce our food is no longer defensible,&quot; said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. </p>
<p>
     But farm owners say U.S.-born workers unfamiliar with farm labor rarely last more than a few days during harvest due to the strenuous nature of the work, and cost companies more because they are less efficient. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The bottom line is if we can&apos;t get H-2A workers there are not too many options,&quot; said Gary Wishnatzki, owner of Florida-based Wish Farms, which grows and markets fruit. &quot;Picking strawberries is a skill, it&apos;s not something the average person off the street can do efficiently.&quot; </p>

Building Industry Seeks Exemption -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By David Harrison and Keiko Morris </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     The construction industry is pushing to keep projects up and running even as some begin to shut down around the country to slow the spread of the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     In Washington, D.C., and in state capitals, industry groups are lobbying to designate construction workers as essential personnel exempt from stay-at-home orders. The industry employs 7.6 million Americans, or 5% of the workforce. </p>
<p>
     That effort has had mixed success. Illinois and California have deemed construction essential but Pennsylvania and Washington state have ordered building sites closed except those deemed essential, such as health care facilities. </p>
<p>
     New York state at first exempted construction but amended its order Friday to shut down all projects except those deemed critical, such as those involving roads, transit, bridges and health care. </p>
<p>
     Last week, industry groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote to President Trump, urging his administration to exempt construction workers from local quarantine orders. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Shutting down the ability of our industries to serve our nation and maintain our physical infrastructure will impact the economic viability of the entire nation, not to mention numerous businesses,&quot; they wrote. </p>
<p>
     Their plea highlights the trade off between battling the spread of the virus and keeping the economy on track. On Tuesday, President Trump said he hoped to have the country back at work in just two weeks -- a timeline at odds with the advice of health professionals. </p>
<p>
     Construction accounts for 4.1% of gross domestic product, but the impact of a nationwide shutdown would spread to manufacturers of building materials and equipment as well as to architects and engineers, said Ken Simonson, chief economist of Associated General Contractors of America, a trade group. </p>
<p>
     While most construction sites remain open, a growing number are shutting down in response to state orders. A survey by the Associated General Contractors released Friday found that 39% of companies had projects stopped by clients or local authorities, up from 28% last week. </p>
<p>
     As sites close, more workers will likely turn to unemployment benefits, further swelling the ranks of recipients. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported a record 3.28 million applications for unemployment benefits in the week ended March 21. </p>
<p>
     The $2 trillion rescue package approved by Congress won&apos;t be enough to help the industry, the AGC said. The group wants lawmakers to spend more on infrastructure, grant relief from losses on federally funded projects and protect construction worker pension plans. </p>
<p>
     Industry groups say construction workers are less at risk from the virus because they often work outdoors and wear protective equipment such as masks and gloves. About 13% of respondents to the AGC&apos;s latest survey said they knew of an infected person on their job site, up from 8% in last week&apos;s survey. </p>
<p>
     North America&apos;s Building Trades Unions has joined industry groups in urging local authorities to keep sites open. Its president, Sean McGarvey, estimated that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of its roughly 3 million members had been laid off. Legislation enacted in Congress last week gave some construction workers sick days for the first time, Mr. McGarvey said. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, said the union would support New York state&apos;s decision to close non-essential construction. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Everybody&apos;s concerned about being out of work,&quot; Karl Pogelschek, a laborer in New York working on the overhaul of LaGuardia Airport, said before New York state&apos;s decision. </p>
<p>
     Construction is a seasonal business that keeps many workers idle in the winter. Many had been expecting to get back to work in the coming weeks, Mr. Pogelschek said. </p>
<p>
     At sites around the country, the epidemic is changing the rhythm of work. </p>
<p>
     Workers who assemble at morning meetings are reminded to keep their distance from each other and asked if anyone feels sick or has been exposed to the virus, said Frank Sciame, chief executive of New York City-based Sciame Construction LLC. </p>
<p>
     Meetings of 10 to 15 people that were typical before the pandemic have been downsized, said Stephen Gray, chief executive of Gray, an engineering, design and construction company. The Kentucky-based company has offices throughout the U.S. and some 300 active projects. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Most job sites that are run well are run with a high level of interaction and require people to be face to face in these trailers,&quot; said Mr. Gray. &quot;Now we&apos;re breaking up meetings, making them much smaller and cleaning these trailers up and sanitizing them more frequently.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Some in the industry say extra safety protocols are insufficient. Even before the pandemic, ensuring workers followed safety guidelines was difficult, and adding new measures probably will be tough to enforce consistently, said a construction superintendent in New York state who declined to be identified because he wasn&apos;t authorized to speak with the press. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I don&apos;t think that right now we should be putting guys at risk building things that are less than essential for their communities,&quot; the superintendent said. </p>
<p>
     Keeping workers a safe distance apart involves complex choreography on a construction site as workers shift between tasks, said Steve Lesser, an attorney at Becker &amp; Poliakoff. One worker not showing up because they are quarantined or caring for someone who is sick can hold up other jobs on the project, he said. </p>
<p>
     Delays can quickly turn a profitable project into an unprofitable one, said Richard Sussman, an attorney at Rosenberg &amp; Estis, P.C. Although most borrowers are protected from default in case of unforeseen circumstances, they still must repay principal and interest on their loans. </p>
<p>
     And unfinished projects may pose a safety hazard, said Mr. Pogelschek, the worker at LaGuardia Airport. </p>
<p>
     &quot;You can&apos;t walk away from a trench in the street,&quot; said Mr. Pogelschek. &quot;It&apos;s no different than doing a roof on your house. Once you start, you&apos;re going to have to finish.&quot; </p>

Trump Signs Record Stimulus Law -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  House-approved relief package of $2 trillion offers aid to combat damage of pandemic </p>
<pre>
By Siobhan Hughes and Natalie Andrews </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- President Trump signed a roughly a $2 trillion stimulus package into law, hours after House lawmakers hustled back to the Capitol to pass the aggressive response to the coronavirus pandemic that has staggered the U.S. economy. </p>
<p>
     The bill is the largest relief package in U.S. history and extends aid to many struggling Americans through direct payments and expanded unemployment insurance. The package provides loans and grants to businesses, augments drained state coffers and sends additional resources to sapped health-care providers. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,&quot; President Trump said in remarks Friday in the Oval Office. He added, in a nod to the size of the package: &quot;I never signed anything with a T on it.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump has told people he wants his signature to appear on the direct payment checks that will go out to many Americans in the coming weeks, according to an administration official. The White House didn&apos;t comment. </p>
<p>
     Normally, a civil servant -- the disbursing officer for the payment center -- would sign federal checks, said Don Hammond, a former senior Treasury Department official. </p>
<p>
     The measure passed the Senate 96-0 earlier in the week and had overwhelming support in the House as well. But it needed to clear one last hurdle on Friday after Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.) tried to force a recorded vote, arguing it would be irresponsible to use a voice vote on such a large bill. This angered many fellow lawmakers, who said making them show up in person risked spreading coronavirus and would needlessly stall aid to Americans. </p>
<p>
     To prevent a delay, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) worked with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.,) to assemble a flotilla of rank-and-file legislators to stop Mr. Massie. Many Democrats and Republicans boarded red-eye flights back to Washington or took long road trips to reach the quorum -- 216 -- needed to outflank Mr. Massie. His maneuver would have succeeded only if the House lacked a quorum or if he had support from one-fifth of the lawmakers to insist on a roll call. Neither was the case. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have our differences, but we also know what is important to us,&quot; Mrs. Pelosi said when she joined Mr. McCarthy at a press conference after the vote. &quot;America&apos;s families are important to us.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The vote came as the Capitol is awash in anxiety over the novel coronavirus. Two additional members of the House -- Rep. Mike Kelly (R., Pa.) and Joe Cunningham (D., S.C.) said Friday they tested positive for the illness. In all, at least five lawmakers have contracted Covid-19, including one, Rep. Ben McAdams (D., Utah), who is on oxygen support in the hospital. </p>
<p>
     For safety reasons, House lawmakers who attended the vote sat several seats away from each other on the chamber&apos;s floor and were scattered throughout the galleries typically reserved for the public. They were under orders to use hand sanitizer when entering and leaving the chamber. Should there have been a roll-call vote, lawmakers would have voted in groups no larger than 30, in alphabetical order. </p>
<p>
     In the most dramatic moment of the floor debate, Rep. Haley Stevens (D., Mich.) donned pink latex gloves as she delivered an impassioned plea to pass the bill, talking beyond her one minute of allotted time and shouting when her own leader, Mr. Hoyer, urged her to suspend so he could extend her more time, while some Republicans jeered. </p>
<p>
     &quot;To our doctors and our nurses, I wear these latex gloves to tell every American: do not be afraid!&quot; said Ms. Stevens, who drove back to Washington from Michigan a day earlier to be present for the vote. </p>
<p>
     Other lawmakers made similar treks. Republican Rep. Tom Reed left his home in Corning, N.Y., at 3 a.m. to make it to the Capitol by the time the debate started. His wife and daughter joined him, driving so that he could get work done. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Because of the concerning tactics that might be being played here, I wanted to make sure I do my part to get this bill passed,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Rep. Dusty Johnson (R., S.D.) took two flights, starting in Sioux Falls -- the first one he could catch. His connecting flight to Reagan National Airport was nearly empty, save for three other lawmakers on board, each in rows 6 feet apart. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It was unfortunate that this last-minute scramble caused taxpayer dollars to be wasted, and public health to be compromised, but our country cannot afford delay,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Other lawmakers vented over Mr. Massie&apos;s move. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s an act of vanity and selfishness that goes beyond comprehension,&quot; said Rep. Dan Kildee (D.,Mich.). &quot;He should be ashamed of himself and the country should scorn him.&quot; </p>
<p>
     On the House floor, some lawmakers took veiled swipes at Mr. Massie, skirting House rules of decorum aimed at preventing personal attacks. &quot;To you who oppose this bill, please, please stand down,&quot; Rep. Fred Upton (R., Mich.) said. &quot;We can&apos;t wait another day to help. Don&apos;t add to this disruption by, in fact, being a disrupter. Be a leader.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Outside the Capitol, Mr. Trump applied his own pressure on Mr. Massie, calling him &quot;a third rate Grandstander.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Massie said that he had been steamrolled, and denied a turn by GOP leaders to speak in the floor debate. &quot;The fix is in,&quot; he said. &quot;If this bill is so great for America, why not allow a vote on it?&quot; </p>
<p>
     After a tense morning, party leaders grew confident as more members reached the Capitol. Stalling for time, Mrs. Pelosi prolonged her floor speech until she could be sure that 216 members were in the chamber. At one point, she asked Messrs. Hoyer and McCarthy: &quot;How are we coming, Mr. Leaders? How are we coming with our gallery?&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ultimately, according to a Democratic leadership aide, about 240 lawmakers made it to their seats. The voice vote occurred with a chorus of ayes and a smattering of nos. Mr. Massie immediately challenged whether there were enough lawmakers in attendance, but was shot down. &quot;A quorum is present, the motion is adopted,&quot; said the presiding officer, Rep. Anthony Brown (D., Md.), to cheers from the lawmakers, who then filed out of the Capitol. </p>
<p>
     Lawmakers are already discussing what could be needed in a subsequent economic-relief package -- which would be the fourth to address the health crisis. Some members say states need more money. Mrs. Pelosi has said she wants to see additional worker-safety protections, along with access to free health care for those who become sick from the virus. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We have a bunch more bills to come,&quot; said Rep. Cedric Richmond (D., La.), whose New Orleans district has one of the highest death counts in the country. </p>

President orders GM to make ventilators, invoking wartime act as outbreak worsens -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Michael C. Bender and Mike Colias </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- President Trump ordered General Motors Co. to sharply ramp up the production of ventilators to treat coronavirus patients, turning to a wartime presidential power that he had been reluctant to use. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump on Friday invoked the Defense Production Act, or DPA, which dates back to the Korean War and gives the president powers to require businesses to produce goods tied to national defense. For weeks he had said that the threat of invoking the DPA was sufficient. Previously he likened using the DPA to nationalizing American business. He reversed course Friday, saying GM was &quot;wasting time&quot; in negotiations with the federal government. </p>
<p>
     With the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 -- the disease caused by the new coronavirus -- topping 100,000 in the U.S. on Friday, worries about a ventilator shortage have grown all the more urgent. </p>
<p>
     GM was already working toward wide-scale ventilator production through a collaboration struck last week with medical-device firm Ventec Life Systems. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, the Detroit auto maker said, &quot;Ventec, GM and our supply base have been working around the clock for weeks to meet this urgent need.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The president had criticized GM and its leadership earlier Friday, saying in a series of Twitter posts that the company had initially said it could supply 40,000 ventilators, but then later said it could make only 6,000 available by late April. In one of his Friday tweets, the president criticized GM Chief Executive Mary Barra as &quot;always a mess.&quot; </p>
<p>
     White House officials said the two sides had been discussing a contract worth about $1 billion, but the talks broke down over the timeline for delivering the devices. </p>
<p>
     Earlier Friday, after the president&apos;s Twitter posts, GM and Ventec said they aimed to produce as many as 10,000 ventilators a month, in part through a new assembly line being set up at a GM facility in Indiana. Closely held Ventec normally makes a few hundred ventilators a month at its facility in Bothell, Wash. </p>
<p>
     The most severely ill patients infected with the new coronavirus have such trouble breathing that they are put on a ventilator, an invasive therapy that involves inserting a tube into the patient&apos;s windpipe. </p>
<p>
     People involved in GM&apos;s efforts said Ventec hadn&apos;t made a firm commitment to deliver a specific number of ventilators, but rather provided the administration with a range of potential production volumes that would scale up to gradually starting in April. </p>
<p>
     With hospitals in some areas experiencing a surge in Covid-19 patients, the Trump administration wanted a faster ramp up to meet the urgent need, a White House official said. </p>
<p>
     GM, and other car companies that have moved to help boost the ventilator supply don&apos;t plan to retool their existing vehicle-assembly plants to produce the devices. Instead, they are lending their expertise in supply-chain management, purchasing and manufacturing to help other medical-device makers boost output. In GM&apos;s case, this meant establishing a new manufacturing line at its electronic-parts factory in Indiana. </p>
<p>
     GM said about 1,000 employees would work on the project and that the company&apos;s resources would be donated &quot;at cost.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Some of GM&apos;s auto-parts suppliers began churning out parts for the ventilators in recent days, the people familiar with the effort said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If you think about what goes into a vehicle -- the air-circulation systems, filtration, electronics, lots of hoses -- a lot of those types of components also are contained in ventilators,&quot; said Carla Bailo, president of the Center for Automotive Research. </p>
<p>
     The president has publicly admonished GM and Ms. Barra personally several times during his tenure. Last year he repeatedly criticized GM for closing factories and laying off workers in Midwestern states. </p>
<p>
     In his series of tweets, Mr. Trump said GM should reopen its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, to make ventilators, &quot;or some other plant.&quot; GM last year sold the Ohio factory to a start-up electric truck maker. </p>
<p>
     President Trump also tweeted that Ford Motor Co. needed to &quot;get going on ventilators, fast!!!&quot; </p>
<p>
     In the past two weeks, several auto makers, including Ford, have disclosed plans to work with medical-device companies to boost ventilator production. Ford this week said it would work with General Electric Co. to increase ventilator supply but didn&apos;t offer specifics. </p>
<p>
     Toyota Motor Corp. said Friday that it is finalizing terms with two ventilator makers to help increase their capacity. </p>
<p>
     The president said later Friday that the administration was working to sign contracts with more than a half-dozen other companies, including General Electric, Philips, Hamilton and Medtronic </p>
<p>
     He said the administration had deals in place to collect 100,000 ventilators within 100 days. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Trump said he was skeptical that the U.S. would need as many ventilators as the administration was collecting, adding that he may send any surplus to other countries. To underscore the point, he said he spoke to the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who tested positive for the virus, and asked how his British counterpart was doing. Mr. Johnson told him: &quot;We need more ventilators.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he is working with medical device-maker Medtronic PLC and has said the auto maker&apos;s New York solar panel factory &quot;will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible.&quot; He also said he acquired ventilators from China and has been working to deliver them in the U.S. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter that he had talked with Mr. Musk late Thursday. &quot;He&apos;s donating hundreds of ventilators to New York City and state, including our public hospitals.&quot; </p>
<p>
     On Friday, Mr. Musk said on Twitter the biggest value Tesla was providing was precise delivery of ventilators to the intensive care units that need them most. &quot;There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues,&quot; he wrote. </p>

Your Health: Researchers Probe Ways Infection Attacks Body -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Sumathi Reddy </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     It starts, most often, with a cough or a sneeze. </p>
<p>
     Thousands of tiny, often invisible droplets of saliva or mucus disperse in the air. You walk by -- within 6 feet of the offender -- and inadvertently inhale the droplets. </p>
<p>
     The novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 begins like most other respiratory viruses. Scientists are still studying what happens in the body when someone gets infected and how the virus in some patients progresses to the lungs, causing viral pneumonia, difficulty breathing, and even death. </p>
<p>
     The race to better understand the virus comes as global death tolls spiral, patients flood emergency rooms, and hospitals at the center of the growing U.S. crisis clamor for supplies. Doctors have been forced to learn much about how the virus works as they go. </p>
<p>
     But there are some things scientists know based on how other similar respiratory viruses work. That coupled with recent case reports from infected patients in China and Washington state have given scientists a basic understanding of how it works though they say there is still much to be learned. </p>
<p>
     The virus most commonly enters the nose through minuscule droplets from someone&apos;s mucus or saliva, says Steve Lawrence, an infectious disease physician at Washington University and Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. This is the primary way of spreading the virus, which is why public health experts and governments are focusing on social distancing as a prevention strategy. It can also enter through the eyes or mouth. </p>
<p>
     Once the virus&apos;s particles enter the body, they begin to attach to a particular receptor on the surface of the body&apos;s cells, usually starting with cells in the mucous membranes in the nose and throat. The coronavirus is distinguished by spiky proteins on its surface; these spikes latch onto cell membranes. The virus then enters the cells and disassembles so its RNA -- molecules that carry instructions from DNA to the body&apos;s cells -- can start to reproduce. </p>
<p>
     &quot;You can find very high levels of virus in the nasal passages even before people have developed cough and fevers, suggesting that it is initially an upper respiratory infection,&quot; says Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital in Boston. </p>
<p>
     Though most people likely start with an upper respiratory infection, it&apos;s also possible that respiratory droplets are inhaled more deeply and go directly into the lungs, says Brian Garibaldi, an associate professor of pulmonary and critical care at Johns Hopkins University. &quot;It has a special protein that binds more tightly to cells in the lower respiratory tract,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>
     Wherever it lands, the virus hijacks cells and starts replicating, ultimately producing millions of viral particles that flood the body. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Like other viruses it takes over the cellular machinery of the cell and makes more copies of itself and spreads,&quot; says Dr. Garibaldi. </p>
<p>
     When your immune system recognizes there&apos;s a new virus in your body it starts using signaling molecules called cytokines to start calling in reinforcements to the site of infection. &quot;Many of those cytokines end up causing a fever,&quot; says Dr. Garibaldi. </p>
<p>
     Once the virus has attacked enough cells in the upper respiratory system, most people will start to feel symptoms. This happens on average five days after being exposed to the virus but it can be sooner or as many as two weeks later, studies show. </p>
<p>
     These early symptoms usually include a dry cough and fever, and sometimes a sore throat, as well as aches and fatigue. Loss of taste and smell have also been reported as early signs of infection. </p>
<p>
     For the majority of people -- roughly 80% according to reports from China -- the symptoms end there and dissipate in a few days or weeks. </p>
<p>
     But for some people, predominantly older people and those with other medical conditions, the virus keeps traveling down and invading cells in the lungs. </p>
<p>
     When the cells start moving down the respiratory system into the lungs it becomes a lower respiratory illness, which is considered more serious. That could happen two to seven days after symptoms start, says Dr. Kuritzkes. </p>
<p>
     Once the virus starts infecting the cells that line the air sacs in the lungs, viral pneumonia develops, which is inflammation of the lungs. Shortness of breath is an indication that the virus is damaging the lungs. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Those people who develop pneumonia or get seriously ill, it&apos;s because they&apos;ve had infection of the lung itself, not just the upper airways,&quot; says Dr. Kuritzkes. </p>
<p>
     And the lungs often face a two-way assault. There is damage from the virus but a second equally debilitating response takes place: The body&apos;s own immune system goes into overdrive, causing more lung damage. </p>
<p>
     Some patients&apos; immune systems flare up, producing a lot of white blood cells that flood the infection site in the lungs, causing damage. They secrete a lot of cytokines that enhance the inflammation, says Dr. Kuritzkes. &quot;That can make it difficult for people to breathe. All this fluid that accumulates and all these extra cells that don&apos;t belong there create a barrier for oxygen exchange,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>
     One key feature that distinguishes Covid-19 from other viruses such as the flu is the high frequency of pneumonia, even in people with only mildly symptomatic cases, he says. </p>
<p>
     Studies of Covid-19 patients whose lungs were examined show several distinctive and unusual patterns. Adam Bernheim, a cardiothoracic radiologist at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, and co-researchers studied the chest CT chest scans of 121 positive coronavirus patients from China. They published their results in the journal Radiology last month. </p>
<p>
     The researchers found a striking pattern: The pneumonia progressed along the lungs&apos; outer edges, as evidenced by hazy, gray circular spots. &quot;A normal lung is black, because it contains air,&quot; says Dr. Bernheim. &quot;In coronavirus with pneumonia, air is being replaced by cells, inflammation, fluid, debris and pus, so it starts to turn gray or even white.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The spots developed in some patients within two days of symptom onset and were nearly universal in patients three days or more later. Dr. Bernheim says the pattern is different from garden-variety bacterial pneumonia that the flu often leads to, which often shows one very dense white area in the lung. </p>
<p>
     When the lung becomes progressively more damaged, that triggers what is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. This typically develops seven to 14 days into the course of the illness. </p>
<p>
     The lungs become less efficient at exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide and continue to become inflamed. Patients need assistance breathing because there&apos;s no therapy to treat ARDS. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The ventilator is buying time for the lung to repair itself after a virus has run its course and the immune system response has calmed down, &quot; says Dr. Garibaldi. </p>
<p>
     Matthew Arentz, a pulmonary and critical care doctor at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland, Wash., published a study in JAMA earlier this month looking at the chest images of the first 21 critically ill Covid-19 patients in the U.S. </p>
<p>
     Two-thirds of the patients were from nursing facilities with an average age of 70-years-old and most had chronic medical conditions. Eighty-four percent required mechanical ventilation and only four people survived, says Dr. Arentz. </p>
<p>
     Chest X-rays demonstrated pneumonia in 19 of the 21 patients, all of whom developed ARDS. </p>
<p>
     Most of the patients who died were unable to maintain adequate oxygen levels due to diseased lungs. But one-third developed heart failure, which is another way some Covid-19 patients are dying. </p>
<p>
     Some doctors say that abrupt onset of heart problems seems to be another distinctive trait of Covid-19 -- heart failure was reported with MERS and does occur rarely with the flu, but appears to be a striking feature in some severe cases of Covid-19, says Dr. Kuritzkes. </p>
<p>
     Case reports from other countries, too, show that some Covid-19 patients experience heart failure or an abnormal heart rhythm, says Dr. Lawrence. </p>
<p>
     Physicians say it&apos;s unclear what&apos;s causing the heart issues. It could be that people&apos;s hearts weaken, or that the hyperactive response of the immune system stresses the heart. Though the risk is greater for those with pre-existing heart conditions, there are also reports of patients without heart disease experiencing cardiac failure from Covid-19, says Dr. Garibaldi. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We don&apos;t know if the virus is doing something to the heart or the heart may have been stressed by the patient&apos;s critical illness because a lot of these patients are older and have other health problems,&quot; says Dr. Arentz. </p>

<p>
     It&apos;s an honest-to-God doomsday scenario and the ultimate doomsday-prepper market is a mess. </p>
<p>
     As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold, investors and bankers are encountering severe shortages of gold bars and coins. Dealers are sold out or closed for the duration. Credit Suisse Group AG, which has minted its own bars since 1856, told clients this week not to bother asking. In London, bankers are chartering private jets and trying to finagle military cargo planes to get their bullion to New York exchanges. </p>
<p>
     It&apos;s getting so bad that Wall Street bankers are asking Canada for help. The Royal Canadian Mint has been swamped with requests to ramp up production of gold bars that could be taken down to New York. </p>
<p>
     With staff reduced at the Royal Canadian Mint because of the virus, the government-owned company is only producing one variation of bullion bars, according to Amanda Bernier, a senior sales manager. She said the mint has received &quot;unprecedented levels of demand,&quot; largely from U.S. banks and brokers. </p>
<p>
     The price of gold futures rose about 9% to roughly $1,620 a troy ounce this week -- that is 31.1034768 grams, per the U.K. Royal Mint -- and neared a seven-year high. Only on a handful of occasions since 2000 have gold prices risen more in a single week, including immediately after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008. </p>
<p>
     &quot;When people think they can&apos;t get something, they want it even more,&quot; says George Gero, 83, who&apos;s been trading gold for more than 50 years, now at RBC Wealth Management in New York. &quot;Look at toilet paper.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Gold has been prized for thousands of years and today goes into items ranging from jewelry to dental crowns to electronics. For decades, the value of paper money was pinned to gold; tons of it sat in Fort Knox to reassure Americans their dollars were worth something. Today they just have to trust. President Nixon unpegged the dollar from gold in 1971. </p>
<p>
     The government still holds lots of gold in Fort Knox, though not as much as it did decades ago. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a massive gold stash. That gold isn&apos;t released on the open market, though; it&apos;s held as reserves for the U.S. and governments around the world. London is the hub of physical gold trading that often changes hands. </p>
<p>
     Gold is popular with survivalists and conspiracy theorists but it is also a sensible addition to investment portfolios because its price tends to be relatively stable. It is especially in-demand during economic crises as a shield against inflation. When the Federal Reserve floods the economy with cash, like it is doing now, dollars can get less valuable. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Gold is the one money that can&apos;t be printed,&quot; said Roy Sebag, CEO of Goldmoney Inc., which has one of the world&apos;s largest private stashes, worth about $2 billion. (He&apos;d rather not say where, for obvious reasons.) </p>
<p>
     There are two ways to own gold: in bars or coins or jewelry stored in bank vaults, or in futures contracts traded on an exchange, which guarantee the holder a certain amount of gold at a certain price on a certain date. </p>
<p>
     Those contracts trade on CME Group Inc.&apos;s Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The problem? Much of the world&apos;s gold is in London and has been since the 17th century, when the Bank of England set up a vault. </p>
<p>
     Today, the Bank of England says it has the second-largest collection of gold in its vault, behind only the New York Fed. </p>
<p>
     The disruptions this week pushed the gold futures price, on the New York exchange, as much as $70 an ounce above the price of physical gold in London. Typically, the two trade within a few dollars of each other. </p>
<p>
     That gulf sparked a high-stakes game of chicken in the New York futures market this week. Sharp-eyed traders started snapping up physical delivery contracts, figuring banks would have trouble finding enough gold to make good and they would be able to squeeze them for cash. That set off a scramble by banks. </p>
<p>
     Goldmoney&apos;s Mr. Sebag said bankers were offering him $100 or more per ounce over the London price to get their hands on some of his New York gold. </p>
<p>
     Wade Brennan, a former gold trader at Scotiabank who now runs an investment firm called Kilo Capital, said he had heard from bankers in the U.S. who were literally checking the corners of their vaults for any gold that might have been overlooked. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Everyone&apos;s looking through the cupboard,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     As of November, London housed 8,263 metric tons of gold, valued at $387.9 billion, according to the London Bullion Market Association. The biggest hoard is kept by the Bank of England, which looks after around 400,000 gold bars on behalf of the U.K. government, commercial banks and central banks in other countries, hidden in nine vaults under the narrow streets of the City of London. </p>
<p>
     Getting gold to New York, where it can be sent on to gold dealers, jewelers, dentists and electronics makers, is a heavy lift in the best of times, and, it turns out, quite tricky during a pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Most gold bars are stowed in the cargo hold of passenger planes. Security firms such as Loomis Group, which arrange the flights and meet planes on the tarmac, don&apos;t like to move more than about five tons on any flight, in case the plane crashes and because of high insurance costs. From there, the haul is trucked under heavy guard to New York warehouses. </p>
<p>
     International flights are largely grounded now. </p>
<p>
     What&apos;s more, there is limited new supply. Mines in countries such as Peru and South Africa are also shut down because of the coronavirus. Once-busy Swiss refineries that turn raw metal into gold bars closed earlier this week as the country&apos;s coronavirus cases neared 10,000. </p>
<p>
     There is still a lot of gold in the world, some $10 trillion worth, but &quot;it&apos;s not in the right place,&quot; said Simon Mikhailovich, co-founder of the Bullion Reserve, which holds on to gold for investors. </p>
<p>
     David Smith owns a wristwatch business in northern England and said Tuesday his bullion dealers weren&apos;t taking any more orders. He has been scouring social media for individuals who might sell to him. </p>
<p>
     &quot;You can&apos;t really get physical gold and silver anywhere at the moment,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     He began investing personally in metals a few years ago after watching videos from Mike Maloney, creator of the website goldsilver.com. Like other online dealers, the site currently has a notice saying products are back-ordered up to 12 weeks and that there is a $1,000 delivery order minimum. </p>
<p>
     The title of Mr. Maloney&apos;s latest podcast: &quot;Unaffordium and unobtanium.&quot; (The latter has popped up in the plots of science fiction movies). </p>
<p>
     The Bank of England on Wednesday emailed banks that keep gold in its vault to reassure them it still had access to deliveries and airports. Bankers with gold vaults in Canary Wharf, on the city&apos;s eastern edge, are worried by the closure of nearby London City Airport, a popular hopping-off point for flights that move gold to and from Switzerland and Luxembourg. </p>
<p>
     For those able to deliver, though, there is big money to be made. In normal times, it costs around 20 cents to fly an ounce of gold, just under 20 cents to melt the bars down and refabricate them to match New York&apos;s delivery standards, and another 10 cents or so in financing costs, according to a retired senior gold trader. (London bars are heavier than those in demand in New York.) </p>
<p>
     So if New York prices are $1 an ounce higher than in London, a bank can make $80,000 moving five metric tons of gold -- almost risk-free. </p>
<p>
     At Tuesday&apos;s prices, the same load would net $11 million in profit, minus the cost of chartering the jet. </p>

Britain&apos;s Boris Johnson Tests Positive for Virus -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Max Colchester and Bojan Pancevski </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     LONDON -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader of a major government to announce he has tested positive for the new coronavirus, highlighting a challenge many governments may face as they seek to confront an unprecedented peacetime crisis. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Johnson said his symptoms were mild and that he would continue to lead the country while he confined himself to his residence for a week. &quot;I am working from home,&quot; said Mr. Johnson in a video he posted online, adding that he would continue to liaise with his team &quot;thanks to the wizardry of modern technology.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The 55-year-old&apos;s diagnosis raises questions about whether other senior British politicians and officials leading the pandemic response have been infected. Later, leading members of his coronavirus team Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty said they were isolating at home after Mr. Hancock tested positive and Mr. Whitty said he had developed symptoms. The heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, said Wednesday he had the virus. </p>
<p>
     The prime minister&apos;s illness demonstrates the difficulties of leadership, which demands personal meetings with senior aides and displays of public reassurance, while conforming to public guidelines to limit contact with others. Many leaders have failed to follow their own government advice. </p>
<p>
     Government offices and legislatures around the world are often housed in archaic buildings that push policy makers into proximity. The British government is run from a warren of interconnected old buildings around Downing Street in central London that serve as residences for the prime minister and others, and as offices for other ministers and senior civil servants. </p>
<p>
     Several other leaders, including President Trump and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who were in close contact with people with the infection have so far tested negative. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump was tested after he hosted a dinner at his Florida resort for a delegation around Brazil&apos;s president Jair Bolsonaro. Over 20 members of the delegation later tested positive. Mr. Bolsonaro, who has been playing down the dangers of the epidemic, has since said that his test came back negative. </p>
<p>
     In Washington, lawmakers and White House officials were stepping up social distancing efforts as they rushed to complete a more than $2 trillion economic response package. </p>
<p>
     About a half dozen senators have self-quarantined in recent weeks as a result of possible exposure to the virus, and one, Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) said he tested positive. The husband of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) a onetime presidential candidate, also fell ill from the virus. In the House, Reps. Mario D&#237;az-Balart (R., Fla.) and Ben McAdams (D., Utah) are sick with the virus, and several others have experienced related symptoms. Mr. McAdams is hospitalized. </p>
<p>
     Most leaders have asked citizens to stop shaking hands and quarantine as soon as they experience symptoms, but not all have led by example. Mark Rutte, the Dutch premier, held a press conference on March 10 to announce that everyone must stop shaking hands and instead use greetings such as bumping elbows -- yet during the address he shook hands with an aide. </p>
<p>
     In late February as the virus took hold in the U.K., Mr. Johnson paid a visit to a hospital, saying later he had shaken hands with patients. On March 11, he met with Queen Elizabeth. </p>
<p>
     Pedro S&#225;nchez, the Spanish prime minister, refused to go into quarantine after his wife tested positive on March 15. His deputy went into self-isolation after the equality minister and his live-in partner tested positive. She is one of three members of the Spanish cabinet who have become infected. </p>
<p>
     After a doctor who had given her a pneumonia vaccine tested positive, Ms. Merkel retreated to her modest apartment overlooking Berlin&apos;s Museum Island, which she shares with her husband. </p>
<p>
     She chaired a cabinet meeting on Monday by telephone. In the cabinet room, her ministers sat at a large round table, preserving a distance of about 6 feet between them, according to a spokesman. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is unfortunately not yet possible to do that via hologram,&quot; Olaf Scholz, the vice chancellor, said. </p>
<p>
     Austria plans for Chancellor Sebastian Kurz&apos;s entire inner circle to quarantine together if someone close to him tests positive. </p>
<p>
     Despite being sick, Mr. Johnson spoke to Mr. Trump by phone Friday. The president wished Mr. Johnson a quick recovery, Downing Street said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Johnson noticed he had mild symptoms, including a cough and a fever, on Thursday afternoon and was tested shortly after. He then stood outside his official residence at 10 Downing Street to participate in countrywide applause of the National Health Service, standing a few feet away from the country&apos;s chancellor of the exchequer. Mr. Johnson was informed at midnight he had the virus. </p>
<p>
     Under U.K. health guidance, a person who is infected must self-isolate for a week to allow the virus to subside. Any people living in the same household as that person must isolate for two weeks, as it can take days for signs of infection to show. </p>
<p>
     The British government has a hierarchy of ministers to replace Mr. Johnson if he can&apos;t perform his duties, of which Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab would be next in line, a government spokesman said. </p>
<p>
     Lawmakers are breaking with tradition to allow them to legislate in the face of the virus. </p>
<p>
     French lawmakers have been among those hit hardest by the epidemic. Some 30 lawmakers and staffers at the National Assembly have tested positive for the virus. As a result, France&apos;s political parties agreed to designate 20 members who lived close to the grand riverside palace to represent them and vote on behalf of the 557 not present. The house also postponed all nonessential bills. </p>
<p>
     The Spanish parliament allowed remote voting in 2011 but speeches can only be made &quot;personally and aloud&quot; in the House. So this week, Mr. S&#225;nchez addressed a near-empty chamber to request a 15-day extension of the state of emergency, with 307 of 350 deputies voting online. </p>
<p>
     Last week, the Swiss federal assembly, founded in 1500, moved to allow its 200 legislators to convene by video or telephone. And on March 20, the European Parliament, the European Union&apos;s legislative body, changed its own rules to allow members to vote on bills and motions by email, attaching a photo of their ballot. </p>
<p>
     The British Parliament, founded in the 13th century, is having a harder time adapting. There, lawmakers still vote on bills by crowding through different lobbies of their Gothic building complex on the Thames. A new guideline instructing members to keep more space between them has created considerable delays in votes. </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, many members of the House of Lords, its upper house, whose average age is 70, have skipped recent sessions due concerns about the virus. On Tuesday, Parliament went into an early four-week recess. </p>

A Real Digital Infrastructure at Last -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  American innovation can bring us tools and solutions that will outlast today&apos;s crisis. </p>
<pre>
By Eric Schmidt </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Like other Americans, technologists are trying to do their part to support the front-line pandemic response. They are creating virus data sets, focusing computing resources on the search for vaccines, tracking the virus&apos;s spread, improving the distribution of critical health care supplies and facilitating online educational tools -- work for which my philanthropy, Schmidt Futures, is providing support. This effort reflects the entrepreneurial, results-driven ethos of today&apos;s tech sector. </p>
<p>
     But every American should be asking where we want the nation to be when the Covid-19 pandemic is over. How could the emerging technologies being deployed in the current crisis propel us into a better future? </p>
<p>
     Consider big data and novel manufacturing. The government lacks a strong grasp of complex supply and distribution chains for life-critical medical equipment and other goods. Specialists in big data analytics should now turn to modeling these networks to develop real-time tracking and data visualization platforms to better inform policy decisions. The predictive maintenance and additive manufacturing that are gaining traction in the military should become more prominent in health care. Some hospitals are already using 3-D printers to fabricate respirator valves, and it&apos;s saving lives. Companies like Amazon know how to supply and distribute efficiently. They will need to provide services and advice to government officials who lack the computing systems and expertise. </p>
<p>
     We should also accelerate the trend toward remote learning, which is being tested today as never before. Online, there is no requirement of proximity, which allows students to get instruction from the best teachers, no matter what school district they reside in. There are already useful online learning tools, but they need to be more equitably distributed. Struggling school districts, community colleges and career technical training institutes could benefit if network connectivity becomes more affordable and applications become accessible to a wider range of learners. Science and engineering labs will also be prompted to think of new ways to integrate young talent; there will be experiments in remote internships and apprenticeships. </p>
<p>
     The need for fast, large-scale experimentation will also accelerate the biotech revolution. Synthetic biology and AI-enabled computer modeling will help us to discover and test more new drugs. Companies and research centers are putting algorithms to work on large data sets to find correlations that would take human researchers years of painstaking laboratory work. As researchers show more results, government agencies like the FDA will face pressure to quicken the trial and vetting process for new drugs, and funding agencies will need to give researchers more flexibility to follow the discoveries wherever they lead. </p>
<p>
     Finally, the country is long overdue for a real digital infrastructure. Government at every level should move to cloud, mobile and web-based software and start treating data as a strategic asset. It&apos;s now painfully obvious that these tools are essential for effective action. Moreover, the American people will need that infrastructure for their daily lives. If we are to build a future economy and education system based on tele-everything, we need a fully connected population and ultrafast infrastructure. The government must make a massive investment -- perhaps as part of a stimulus package -- to convert the nation&apos;s digital infrastructure to cloud-based platforms and link them with a 5G network. </p>
<p>
     The American people are problem-solvers and innovators, and we have the opportunity today for farsighted action. If we invest strategically and mobilize our society, we can build the digital infrastructure necessary to enjoy a higher and healthier standard of living and to solve complex modern problems like today&apos;s pandemic. </p>

Local Leaders Showing The Way Forward -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  The crisis will renew respect for compe-tence and expertise. </p>
<pre>
By Jeb Bush </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     As governor of Florida, I dealt with the aftermath of 9/11, major floods and fires, and an anthrax attack, as well as eight hurricanes and four tropical storms over just 16 months. Each crisis, however difficult, was a learning opportunity. Each made our state and local emergency responders better at their jobs and improved Florida&apos;s capacity to deal with future problems. </p>
<p>
     The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented crisis, challenging all of us to protect our families&apos; health and survive the severe economic consequences of self-quarantining. The risks are real, and the path forward is uncertain. But we will get through this, and the experience is likely to bring about significant changes in our society. </p>
<p>
     First, dealing with the coronavirus will help to restore respect for leadership and expertise. Glued to our television sets, we see mayors, governors and public-health professionals making tough decisions and exuding competence. No &quot;the-dog-ate-my-homework&quot; and &quot;it&apos;s-not-my-fault&quot; excuses -- just old-school, inspired leadership. </p>
<p>
     Once the trauma passes, I feel sure that more Americans will appreciate leadership based on evidence, problem-solving and consensus-building. They will see the importance of skill, professionalism and science-based solutions. Support for these values could go a long way toward reducing the hyperpartisanship that now paralyzes Washington. </p>
<p>
     Second, for most of our history, America has been a bottom-up country, relying less on the federal government than on what Edmund Burke called the &quot;little platoons&quot; and on governments closer to the people they serve. Over the past generation, we have seen the federal government encroach ever more. The federal government&apos;s inability to respond quickly and effectively to the coronavirus is creating a newfound respect for local initiatives, private-sector creativity, personal responsibility and civic engagement. Let us hope that Washington loosens its grip on policy and allows federalism to bloom. </p>
<p>
     Finally, we need to use today&apos;s crisis as a learning opportunity. Millions of Americans are asking: Why does it take so long for a vaccine to become available? How did the U.S. become dependent on Chinese manufacturing for vital pharmaceutical ingredients? How can China build a hospital in weeks while we seem paralyzed? Why do licensing laws restrict health-care providers from providing care? Where on Earth are the ventilators? The list is long and varied. </p>
<p>
     The explanation for many of these problems is that outdated 20th-century rules stymie 21st-century innovation. In an emergency, many of those rules can be waived by executive order. After the crisis, there will be momentum to challenge the stale rules that hindered our response. This is likely to go well beyond dealing with pandemics. </p>
<p>
     Telehealth, for instance, should become more commonplace, both because of the shortage of health-care professionals and because of the help it provides in delivering care efficiently. And as millions of American families are discovering, online instruction is a viable means for students to learn. States will need to figure out how to change licensing and payment rules to encourage these revolutions in vital services. </p>
<p>
     During and after this crisis, across the policy spectrum, in both the public and private sectors, people will ask, &quot;If we weren&apos;t doing it this way, how would we do it?&quot; By making this question our post-pandemic mantra, we will become more nimble and innovative, less reliant on Washington and more focused on the long-term issues that will drive America toward a more purposeful and prosperous future. </p>
<p>

Marriage With Family At Its Center -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  In trying times, we realize the meaning of commitment. </p>
<pre>
By W. Bradford Wilcox </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     On March 13 -- the day my wife informed me that our weekend date night was off because our governor had declared a state of emergency -- I had an inkling that big changes were in store for our marriage. A few days later, as we found ourselves barely managing to home-school six children, work two jobs and run a big household on lockdown, I knew that the loss of a regular date night was going to be the least of our marital challenges. Scenarios like ours -- and ones much, much harder, with millions of parents losing jobs, heading to the front lines to battle the virus or grieving the loss of loved ones -- are playing out in homes across America. </p>
<p>
     There is no doubt that the fallout of this pandemic will exact a toll on marriage in America. The marriage rate will fall, as fewer men and women have the confidence to head to the altar amid the greatest recession in our lifetime -- much as the marriage rate fell in the wake of the Great Recession. </p>
<p>
     For those who are already married, the stresses and strains of marriage and family life in the time of Covid-19 will send thousands of couples to divorce court. Marital failure will be especially common for husbands and wives under the sway of what I call the &quot;soul mate model&quot; of marriage. The soul mate model -- trumpeted in books like Elizabeth Gilbert&apos;s &quot;Eat, Pray, Love,&quot; not to mention countless songs and rom-coms -- is the idea that marriage is primarily about an intense emotional and romantic connection between two people and should last only so long as that connection remains happy and fulfilling for both parties. This self-centered model gained in popularity for many Americans starting in the 1970s, the &quot;Me Decade.&quot; </p>
<p>
     But feelings are a fragile foundation for marriage. A recent YouGov survey indicates that married people in California who hold this view of marriage are about 60% more likely to think their marriage might end in divorce, compared with those who have a more family-first model of marriage, believing that &quot;Marriage is about romance but also the kids, money, raising a family together.&quot; No doubt the disappearance of date nights and so much more in today&apos;s trying times will undo many marriages founded on the idea that marriage is supposed to make you feel good all the time. </p>
<p>
     The silver lining here is that -- in the face of so much trauma and economic dislocation -- most marriages will not collapse, and many will instead emerge stronger and more stable as husbands and wives develop a new appreciation for how much they love and depend on their spouse -- and how much they, their kids and their kin depend on them keeping their marriage together. As I wrote a decade ago about the Great Recession, the hardship &quot;led many Americans to deepen their commitment to marriage and, in some cases, to table or cancel their plans to divorce or separate.&quot; In fact, the divorce rate dropped in the immediate wake of that economic downturn and has fallen more than 20% over the last decade. The divorce rate is likely to fall even faster in the wake of this new crisis. </p>
<p>
     That&apos;s because in times of trial and tribulation, most people -- and most spouses -- don&apos;t become more self-centered, they become more other-centered, more cognizant of how much they need their family members to navigate difficult and dark times. In post-Covid-19 America, I&apos;m confident that the family-first model of marriage will gain ground against the soul mate model. </p>
<p>
     As for me and my bride, we didn&apos;t enjoy a date night last weekend, but I was able to deliver food, some socially distanced conversation and air hugs from the grandchildren to my homebound 70-something in-laws. And it felt better than date night. </p>

Big Trouble For the Performing Arts -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Institutions of all sizes are faced with financial disaster. </p>
<pre>
By Terry Teachout </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Of all the bad tidings brought by the coronavirus, here&apos;s the scariest piece of news for lovers of the performing arts: The Metropolitan Opera is canceling the rest of its current season -- and furloughing its orchestra members, choristers, dancers and stagehands. That reportedly comes to more than 500 people. What&apos;s more, the unions aren&apos;t protesting. As Leonard Egert, national executive director of the American Guild of Musical Artists, told the New York Times: &quot;We&apos;re disappointed, we&apos;re upset, but we understand.&quot; </p>
<p>
     You don&apos;t have to be an opera buff to grasp the wider implications of this development. The Met is America&apos;s largest performing arts organization. While it&apos;s weathered severe budgetary problems in recent seasons, it&apos;s successfully dealt with all of them -- until now. As a result of the social-distancing lockdown in New York caused by Covid-19, the Met is staring down losses of up to $60 million. That&apos;s a hit the company can&apos;t survive without drastic measures in response. Hence the furloughs -- and the absence of squawking. Everybody can count. </p>
<p>
     What&apos;s happening at the Met is happening at every performing-arts organization I know of, large and small alike. Opera, orchestras, dance companies, theater troupes, nightclubs: All have seen their revenues collapse overnight. And unlike the Met, which has a $300 million endowment, most of them have next to nothing in the bank to see them through the crisis. The results are alarmingly self-evident. As I write these words, the producers of two Broadway plays already in previews, &quot;Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; and &quot;Hangmen,&quot; have announced that neither show will go on, even after Broadway&apos;s theaters reopen. More such announcements are inevitable. </p>
<p>
     I&apos;m hearing much the same thing from coast to coast, though the institutional damage done by the coronavirus looks at first glance to be especially devastating to theater. Even the biggest regional theaters have either laid off staff or are days away from doing so. Few artistic directors feel comfortable speaking on the record, but the boss of one of the country&apos;s top regional houses, who just furloughed three-quarters of his employees, told me that &quot;I have never had to do anything this drastic in my entire professional career. It&apos;s horrible.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Imagine, then, the plight of the smaller companies, the no-budget storefront and off-Broadway houses whose risk-taking productions supply the artistic fertilizer for America&apos;s theatrical culture. Many of these groups -- perhaps most of the smaller ones -- simply won&apos;t reopen when the crisis abates. As for the actors, directors, playwrights, designers and other professionals who make sure there&apos;s a show onstage when the curtain goes up...well, they&apos;re in can&apos;t-pay-the-rent trouble. As one of them, the writer and director Daniel Goldstein, told the New Yorker, &quot;All theater people, except the ones who have institutional jobs -- we&apos;re gig people. We&apos;re no different than a handyman. When the theaters closed, we were literally all unemployed. Everyone I know is unemployed.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For now, charitable contributions are helping to ease the bite. One online company, Goldstar Events, which sells half-price tickets to big-city live performances, has just retrofitted its website, www.goldstar.com, as a platform through which you can make direct donations to performing-arts organizations of all kinds. Those donations will make a difference. Says Michael Halberstam, artistic director of Chicago&apos;s Writers Theatre, the best regional theater in America: &quot;We need your support now more than ever in the history of theater in this country. Without ticket sales, we&apos;re almost entirely dependent on individuals, corporations and foundations for our very survival.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Nothing, of course, can kill off the performing arts. By bringing audiences together to participate in collective acts of truth and beauty, they provide us with a communion of souls that speaks to something fundamental in the human heart. But the challenge posed by Covid-19 is far greater than anything else they have faced in my lifetime, and the story of the havoc that it will wreak is one I dread to tell. </p>

Health Surveillance Is Here to Stay -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  How much privacy will Americans be willing to give up for a better chance of defeating the new coronavirus? </p>
<pre>
By Carrie Cordero and Richard Fontaine </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Washington&apos;s post-9/11 debate about how much surveillance a free society should allow has suddenly become about much more than counterterrorism and national security. Amid today&apos;s global pandemic, key technology companies are in talks with federal and state governments about employing their tools against Covid-19. Facebook, which holds a trove of geolocation information, is sharing disease-migration maps. Clearview AI, a facial-recognition tech firm, may be able to track infected patients and identify people they have met. Smart thermometers are recording and transmitting fevers in real time. The data firm Palantir is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect and analyze vast information streams. </p>
<p>
     All this and more, we hope, will help to stop the virus in its tracks, save lives and help Americans get back to normal. But such efforts -- done in haste -- also raise searching questions about the balance between privacy and public health. Decisions being made on the fly by governments, private firms and individuals will change the country&apos;s digital social contract for years to come. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s approach to monitoring its infected citizens is famously authoritarian, with a new app telling users whether they can move freely based on a personal health analysis -- and, not incidentally, sharing their location with the police. Citizens in democracies would no doubt reject such intrusive measures, but the pandemic has spurred key countries to consider new infringements on privacy. </p>
<p>
     British officials, for example, hope to roll out a new smartphone app that will alert users who have come in contact with an infected individual, using location data drawn from GPS, Wi-Fi networks and even Bluetooth beacons. A separate app, developed by researchers outside of government, will map British infections and share information with officials. Its developers say the U.K. government can delete the data at some point and pledge not to publicize the movements of infected patients. </p>
<p>
     But South Korea has done just that. By analyzing cellphone locations, CCTV feeds and bank transactions, Seoul has established a publicly available website that tracks individual locations and contacts. Interested observers have already mined the data to make guesses about who is visiting &quot;love hotels&quot; and having affairs. Meanwhile, Israel&apos;s Shin Bet domestic security service has established a system that combines individuals&apos; credit history with cell-based location information -- and works even if a phone&apos;s tracking is disabled. </p>
<p>
     These measures seem to help fight the virus, and help right now is what we need. If such steps do work, how much privacy will Americans be willing to give up for a better shot at dodging the virus? </p>
<p>
     Data is already used in ways that many Americans haven&apos;t fully digested. For example, information from fitness trackers -- which monitor sleep patterns, heart rates and location, among other things -- is already used in personal-injury lawsuits, criminal cases and divorce proceedings. </p>
<p>
     Today&apos;s crisis is the new coronavirus, but there will be a temptation to trade personal information for better health monitoring across a range of activities. Cardiac signature recognition can detect heartbeat patterns at a distance, which might help doctors but could also be used to identify individuals. DNA phenotyping may help physicians prescribe more targeted treatments but might also predict facial features. Would any of this be fair game in the next crisis? </p>
<p>
     To answer that, Americans will need to know what data is going where, to whom, for how long, for what purposes and how all this will be overseen. Government officials and tech firms insist that their collaboration in the coronavirus fight will preserve anonymity, protect civil liberties and have an expiration date. But everyone is moving fast. It&apos;s not too early to look closely at both the disease and the digital treatments that officials are prescribing. </p>

The Return to Dining Together -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Social distancing has brought quiet to our tables for now, but we&apos;ll find new rules for group eating. </p>
<pre>
By Bee Wilson </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     At the beginning of March, I spent a magical afternoon with a group of fellow food writers touring the markets of Istanbul. Food writers are greedy people, and as we walked through the jostling streets, we shared bites of this and nibbles of that with each other, curious to taste everything that the city had to offer. The dishes were unbelievably good, all the more so because of the way we were sharing them from hand to hand. </p>
<p>
     It now seems almost miraculous to remember that the act of eating could have been so free and trusting. Suddenly, the idea of sharing food hand to hand with a group of strangers is off the table, along with so many other forms of sociable eating. </p>
<p>
     Our thinking about food looks dramatically different in the wake of the coronavirus. Until recently, we were living through the most open and diverse era of public eating the world has ever seen. Never in human history had there been such a variety of cafes and restaurants, street food markets and sushi joints, taco trucks and noodle bars -- all of them full of people innocently enjoying delicious things with friends outside of the home. </p>
<p>
     But social distancing has changed the rules of eating. It used to seem rude to refuse someone&apos;s offer to share food. Now, all of a sudden, the act of offering food has become more complex, particularly if the recipient is elderly or vulnerable, although it&apos;s reassuring to know that so far, the evidence suggests that Covid-19 is not spread through food itself. </p>
<p>
     Table manners have changed many times before. Until the 18th century, Westerners believed that eating with fingers was more polite than eating with forks. But never has there been such a precipitous shift in eating etiquette as the one happening right now. One day, people are making wry jokes on Twitter about the coronavirus bringing an end to the fashion for &quot;sharing plates.&quot; A few days later, New York, San Francisco, Paris and other cities famed for their food have closed their restaurants to diners, and it&apos;s unclear if so many beloved businesses will recover. </p>
<p>
     Some of the ways that we have adjusted our behavior around food have been welcome. It&apos;s no bad thing that people are finally starting to see they actually do need to wash their hands before eating. For years, I have been nagging my children to wash their hands before dinner, but it is only now that they understand why it matters. </p>
<p>
     These anxious times have also refocused our minds on the sheer importance of food for our survival and well-being. Lentils and beans are suddenly disappearing from store shelves. The upside of self-isolation, for many people, is that it allows us to give the preparation of meals the time it deserves, at long last. Cocooned in the house for longer than usual, I find myself turning back to long-forgotten recipes for comfort. </p>
<p>
     What none of us knows right now is how many post-coronavirus changes to eating etiquette will be permanent. One change I pray won&apos;t last forever is the erosion of hospitality, whether it&apos;s dinner in a restaurant or the easy charm of a meal at home shared with friends. </p>
<p>
     In these times of life and death, many pundits have started to describe eating in company for pleasure, rather than for mere survival, as something nonessential and frivolous. It goes without saying that we each need to do our part right now to help get the pandemic under control. But I yearn for the day when the restaurants reopen and we once again trust each other enough to eat from hand to well-washed hand. </p>

A Moment to Renew American Statesmanship -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  The global challenges ahead demand a return to character, vision and discipline in applying U.S. power. </p>
<pre>
By William J. Burns </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     In the spring of 1919, as the world&apos;s major powers descended on Versailles to negotiate peace after World War I, President Woodrow Wilson was in bed with the flu. At a moment when, as Wilson&apos;s doctor put it, &quot;the whole of civilization seemed to be in the balance,&quot; a horrific influenza pandemic cast a shadow over the prospect of a new order. </p>
<p>
     A century later, we find ourselves again crippled by a pandemic during another of those rare plastic moments in world affairs -- a perfect storm of major shifts in the balance of power and massive political, economic, technological and environmental transformations. Great-power rivalry is back; China has risen, and America&apos;s old dominance has been spent. The world&apos;s economic and military center of gravity is shifting from West to East. A technological revolution is upending how we live, work and fight. Tensions are growing between open and closed societies, with nationalism and authoritarianism resurgent and democracy seemingly in reverse. The tailwinds of globalization have transformed into powerful headwinds, even as climate change looms as an existential threat. </p>
<p>
     The storm has been gathering for some time, and America&apos;s post-Cold War missteps quickened the landfall. Today&apos;s coronavirus pandemic will further intensify the storm&apos;s severity, with terrible human and economic costs. It will be a painful accelerant -- exposing our vulnerabilities and magnifying the challenge of navigating a crowded, complicated and competitive international landscape. </p>
<p>
     The crisis will reinforce cocky convictions -- from Moscow to Beijing -- about the demise of a &quot;liberal international order.&quot; It will spur strongmen to grip even tighter, bolstered by new surveillance technologies. Narrow-minded nationalists will fan the flames of xenophobia. Key Western democracies, already infected by paralytic politics and constipated governance, will see their crisis of self-confidence deepen. </p>
<p>
     Connectivity will be seen as a weakness, not a strength, dealing another blow to the fragile European project. The Middle East and Africa, already burdened by conflicts and pathologies, will be exposed to even more troubles. The U.N. and other international institutions, long groaning and creaking, will start to crack, as will the alliances that have bolstered American security. Global humanitarian crises will worsen, their toll compounded by the virus and an increasingly under-resourced and distracted global response. </p>
<p>
     But shocks like this awful pandemic can clarify as well as accelerate. With brutal impact, they give us a chance to diagnose our challenges with clear eyes. The test for American statesmanship will be to resist the temptation to pull up the drawbridges and retreat, as well as the illusion that we can restore the easy dominance we once enjoyed. </p>
<p>
     We cannot resurrect the uniquely commanding positions that helped American statesmen in the administrations led by Harry Truman and George H.W. Bush shape similar plastic moments over the past century. But we can revive their model of character, vision and discipline in applying American power. We can rebuild America&apos;s democratic example and rekindle the confidence of our allies and the respect of our rivals. Even in this most difficult of moments, we have a rare opening to recover a sense of national purpose and enlightened self-interest and to help Americans -- and the world -- find shelter from the storm. </p>

It&apos;s Time for Washington to Step Up -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  There&apos;s no substitute for federal leadership and resources in dealing with disasters. </p>
<pre>
By Rahm Emanuel </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Warren Buffett once noted that &quot;only when the tide goes out do you discover who&apos;s been swimming naked.&quot; When it comes to emergency management and public health, the tide is out, and the federal government has been caught with its pants down. For decades, we&apos;ve failed to invest sufficiently in the nation&apos;s public health system, but the crisis we face today will not be one-of-a-kind. If we&apos;re going to make sure that future pandemics do not automatically precipitate an economic depression, Washington is going to have to step up. </p>
<p>
     In recent weeks, state and local authorities have filled some of the void in the face of federal dysfunction. Beyond the first responders, doctors, nurses and other hospital employees on the front lines, the heroes of this crisis have been focused, energetic executives such as Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles and Governors Andrew Cuomo (New York), Mike DeWine (Ohio), J.B. Pritzker (Illinois) and Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan). </p>
<p>
     But there&apos;s no substitute for federal leadership, as we&apos;ve seen in past crises. FEMA&apos;s botched response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992 spurred change in Washington. A year later, President Clinton appointed James Lee Witt as FEMA director, and he led quick and effective responses to disasters time and again. And in 2010, in dealing with the Deepwater Horizon disaster, President Obama was determined to provide a counterpoint to the inept federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. </p>
<p>
     Though mayors and governors can do a lot, national crises and challenges ultimately need national solutions. States shouldn&apos;t be bidding against one another for masks and ventilators as they are today -- the federal government should be the clearing house. State bureaucracies should not be forced to keep an eye on diseases spreading from China or other parts of the world -- that should be up to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Security Council. States can&apos;t fund research for medical treatments at the scale made possible by the National Institutes of Health. And on and on. </p>
<p>
     Washington&apos;s failure today is just a more extreme example of the dynamic that has emerged as a feature of life in the nation&apos;s cities and states: Too often the federal government simply doesn&apos;t show up. </p>
<p>
     In Chicago, we made community college free without any help from Washington, but that wasn&apos;t because we didn&apos;t want to work with the federal Department of Education. They just had nothing to offer. We would have gladly accepted the federal Department of Transportation&apos;s help in expanding O&apos;Hare, our largest airport, but we couldn&apos;t wait for the federal bureaucracy to get its act together. </p>
<p>
     Partisanship aside, the frustration with Washington is substantive, persistent and real. State and local leaders have taken the lead out of necessity, not just opportunity. We&apos;d rather have a federal partner on any initiative. </p>
<p>
     No matter who takes the oath of office next January, I expect the next administration will invest more money and attention in the agencies that partner with state and local government to address a host of crises. H1N1, SARS, Ebola -- health challenges have become a steady drumbeat that, with climate change and globalization, will accelerate. Good on state and local leaders for stepping up, but Washington&apos;s role remains indispensable in meeting the challenges of tomorrow. </p>
<p>

A New Frontier for Medical Technology -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Tele-health systems are growing rapidly in response to the crisis. </p>
<pre>
By Amy Compton-Phillips </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Around 8 p.m. on Jan. 20, I received the call: A test had confirmed that one of the hospitals where I oversee clinical care, in Everett, Wash., had admitted the first Covid-19 patient in the U.S. The coronavirus bomb went off in our corner of the country that day, and we quickly realized that the pandemic would change health care faster than anything before. We are now leveraging telehealth technology in ways that will last long after this pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The Providence health system, where I work, now has more than 1,200 beds occupied by patients who have the virus or are suspected of having it across the seven states in the western U.S. where we operate. We&apos;re now testing more than 11,000 people a day and are running four clinical trials. </p>
<p>
     Within several weeks we were sharing lessons we had learned, from the importance of planning and data to treating all patients suspected of infection as though they already had it. We shared remote technology with colleagues, such as an online AI tool to help patients determine for themselves, from home, the level of care they need and how to get it. </p>
<p>
     The severity and suddenness of the Covid-19 emergency have hastened changes to how we deliver care. Red tape that initially hamstrung the Food and Drug Administration has been removed to speed the development of testing and treatments. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued waivers that allow cross-state licensing of medical professionals and reimbursement for telehealth measures. We&apos;ve been trying to accomplish some of these things for years, and they all happened in the last six weeks. </p>
<p>
     Long before Covid-19, our team had created a strategic plan called &quot;Clinical Care 2030&quot; to use technology to provide personalized, affordable care by the end of this decade. Those priorities are suddenly on the fast track. We&apos;re using technology today in ways that any public or private health system can do, in the current emergency and in the future. </p>
<p>
     To increase intensive care capacity, our teleICU command centers remotely monitor ICU rooms and direct care as needed. A nurse at a command center in Montana can monitor ICU patients in a Washington hospital and alert a physician to a change in a patient&apos;s status, just as if they were located in the same building. </p>
<p>
     For staffing shortages, our &quot;telehospitalist&quot; program lets hospitals bring in more physicians in a hurry. We have more than 10,000 doctors enrolled to help manage patients remotely, which can provide expert care in an area experiencing a surge of patients without needing to physically move the physicians. </p>
<p>
     So far, most patients don&apos;t need to be hospitalized, and treating people at home lets us reserve our limited acute care resources for those with severe symptoms. Our telehealth service is keeping a virtual eye on patients showing signs of possible Covid-19 via a pulse oximeter (a simple oxygen sensor placed on the finger) and a digital thermometer. If symptoms worsen, we quickly arrange additional care. We have monitored over 500 patients so far and have the capacity for 4,000, with more in the works. </p>
<p>
     Covid-19 has created a global crisis, but it has also fueled a sudden leap toward the future of medicine. Across the country, we are driving changes that will bring better health care to everyone once this nightmare finally ends. </p>

  Robert Stone&apos;s novels turned a reportorial eye on the U.S.&apos;s shifting role in the world </p>
<pre>
By Leo Robson </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     The life of Robert Stone contained virtually all the things one might consider essential to qualifying as a major postwar American novelist: a National Book Award (for &quot;Dog Soldiers,&quot; in 1975), movie adaptations, A-list friendships ( Paul Newman, Nick Nolte), a succession of lucrative grants and residencies, depression exacerbated by drink and drugs, escalating advances, extensive dealings with Cond&#233; Nast, contrarian reviews in the late 1990s from Michiko Kakutani and James Wood. But whatever his credentials, however wide the recognition, Stone&apos;s friend, the novelist Madison Smartt Bell, was still duty-bound, like virtually all first biographers, to make a full-throated case for his continuing relevance and appeal. &quot;Child of Light&quot; forms part of a three-pronged onslaught, along with a Library of America edition of Stone&apos;s best-known novels and a selection of essays, &quot;The Eye You See With,&quot; both edited by Mr. Bell, but the reader who battles through these 2,000 pages might be forgiven for wondering at the scale of the tribute. Mr. Bell, in his role of biographer, proves as liable to presuppose his subject&apos;s importance (&quot;a complete maverick,&quot; &quot;one of the world&apos;s most brilliant, difficult, extraordinary men&quot;) as the writer himself was in pontifical exercises called things like &quot;What Fiction Is For,&quot; while the freshly canonized novels, never at the cutting edge, too often seem slickly platitudinous and baldly conventional. </p>
<p>
     Stone was born in 1937, in New York. He never knew his father. His mother, the daughter of a tugboat captain, was a sometime teacher and a schizophrenic. His childhood was a mess -- &quot;in all the obvious ways it could be bad,&quot; Stone recalled, &quot;it was.&quot; He was raised by the Marist Brothers, who beat him but also gave him books, and he became an avid teenage drinker and dope-smoker. At 17 he joined the Navy, and was able to visit or glimpse South Africa, Cuba and Greece. While at sea, he began writing stories and read Melville along with various modernists ( Wallace Stevens, Joyce). After his return to New York in 1960, he met his future wife, Janice -- a union that lasted, against some staggering odds (notably, Stone&apos;s alcoholism), until his death in 2015. </p>
<p>
     In 1962 Stone was accepted as a Stegner Fellow in creative writing at Stanford. While living in San Francisco, the Stones got to know Ken Kesey, the acid-dropping author of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot; and leader of the so-called Merry Pranksters. Stone became a key witness for Tom Wolfe&apos;s plunge into this scene, &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (1968), but by then Stone was already pursuing his own fate as a kind of reportorial novelist. Over the next 45 years, despite what Mr. Bell calls his &quot;penchant for procrastination,&quot; he published eight novels principally concerned with the contradictions in America&apos;s self-image, often based on firsthand observation, and set in a series of locales heaving with corruption, conflict and tension: New Orleans, Vietnam (from where heroin is trafficked back to a California sour with dashed hopes, in &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot;), Nicaragua (renamed), Hollywood (with visits to Mexico), New York Harbor, Jerusalem and the Caribbean. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Bell starts with the contention that Stone&apos;s work &quot;chronicled both the peak and the decline of a great many aspects of U.S. world dominance.&quot; Stone wrote about the ways in which American conviction in its own benevolence brought ill effects abroad that, in many instances, poisoned affairs at home as well. (His influence can be seen today in the writing of Rachel Kushner and Jennifer Egan.) But Mr. Bell also wants to present Stone as an &quot;artist&quot; -- the word and its cognates occur frequently in his account. Stone himself made lofty reference in his fiction to things that are difficult to &quot;verbalize&quot; and that &quot;cannot be fully described.&quot; And yet his prose never shows the slightest hint of strain or striving. We are confined to the realm of purely theoretical complexity, a land characterized by bland adjectives and banal syntax. Stone writes about the crazy and zany, the freakish and freaked-out, the extreme and extremist, with anesthetic poise, as in this description from his breakthrough novel, &quot;Dog Soldiers,&quot; of the aftermath of a bombing: </p>
<p>
     Converse went across the street and watched the ambulance people lug body bags over the rubble. Dead people and people who appeared to be dead had been laid out on the exposed earth where the cement had been blown away, and the blood and tissue were draining into the black soil. </p>
<p>
     Even as he claimed personal allegiance with the &apos;60s counterculture, he was also representative of what he saw as the politically motivated &quot;resurgence of realism&quot; that arrived at around the same time to sweep away postmodernism. (His exact contemporary Thomas Pynchon showed that you can in fact be politicized and postmodern, antiwar and antirealist.) </p>
<p>
     Reading the Library of America volume alongside &quot;The Eye You See With&quot; reveals the narrow empiricism of Stone&apos;s project as a writer. In 1971 he published an account in the Guardian of a visit to Vietnam entitled &quot;There It Is&quot; (a shoulder-shrugging catchphrase along the lines of Kurt Vonnegut&apos;s &quot;So it goes&quot;). Stone recycled many of his thoughts in &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot;: &quot;There it is, he said to himself. That was what everyone said -- GIs, reporters, even Arvins and bar girls. There it is.&quot; The evocation of the bombed-out tax office is borrowed almost verbatim, right down to the patly nihilistic payoff, with both Stone and his creation Converse pausing to reflect on the lizards that the previous occupant of his Saigon hotel room had smashed against the wall with a fist. </p>
<p>
     Stone was a thin-skinned, solitary, depressive type with a gruff, bearded, gregarious exterior, and his analysis of male anomie tends to blur the boundary between the would-be existentialist and the contentedly hard-boiled. In the 1981 geopolitical thriller &quot;A Flag for Sunrise&quot; -- a substantial but portentous attempt to grapple with U.S. meddling in Central America -- the anthropologist Holliwell, set to leave New York for a place called Compostela, is asked by a friend, Marty Nolan, to report on the activities of some American expats on the Caribbean coast of &quot;Tecan.&quot; Holliwell declines, and Nolan appears to give in, but as a parting shot he says that Holliwell &quot;may feel differently&quot; when he arrives, and that the request may be repeated through &quot;a third party.&quot; Somehow it isn&apos;t until Holliwell is &quot;halfway across the Brooklyn Bridge&quot; that &quot;the suggestion of a threat in Nolan&apos;s final words struck him.&quot; This is his response: </p>
<p>
     A chill touched his inward loneliness. He was, he knew at that moment, really without beliefs, without hope -- either for himself or for the world. Almost without friends, certainly without allies. Alone. </p>
<p>
     It&apos;s a characteristic Stone cadence. But how is that final adjective supposed to produce its intended clinching effect? Earlier in the paragraph, Nolan&apos;s words have already made Holliwell &quot;think of the man entombed beside the Perfume River,&quot; and then we have, in quick succession, &quot;loneliness,&quot; &quot;without friends,&quot; &quot;without allies.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The most recent novel collected in the Library of America edition, &quot;Outerbridge Reach&quot; (1992), though very much in the Stone mold, poses a different set of problems. (All three novels in the Library of America volume made the shortlist for the National Book Award, as did a fourth, &quot;Damascus Gate.&quot;) It is another example of Stone&apos;s favored &quot;convergence structure,&quot; a narrative approach that, in its continual need to situate different characters, shows excessive reliance on the &quot;Meanwhile . . .&quot; construction. The book toggles between the cash-strapped Owen Browne, a Vietnam veteran who writes PR copy for a yacht company; his wife, Anne, a journalist and daughter of a rich local businessman; and Strickland, a documentary maker devoted to &quot;the human factor.&quot; After Browne agrees to take part in a lucrative solo circumnavigation race in place of his Trump-like boss (&quot;a millionaire vulgarian in the contemporary mode&quot;), Strickland and Anne embark on an affair while engaging in back-and-forth about &quot;the trick&quot; to life, what &quot;guys&quot; know and the meaning of &quot;honesty.&quot; </p>
<p>
     During a reflection on naval history, Owen Browne notes that the authors seem to crib from each other, and Stone himself became embroiled in a plagiarism dispute relating to the book. Browne&apos;s decision to falsify his geographical location, in order to win the boat race, was, as Stone cagily put it, &quot;suggested by an incident that actually occurred&quot; -- the doomed exploits of the yachtsman Donald Crowhurst, as uncovered by the English journalists Ron Hall and Nicholas Tomalin and recorded in their extraordinary 1970 book, &quot;The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Hall complained about the uncredited borrowing (Tomalin had died while reporting on the Yom Kippur War in 1973). Mr. Bell mocks the idea that the Crowhurst story &quot;somehow&quot; existed outside the &quot;public domain,&quot; but as Hall tried to explain at the time, &quot;no story could have derived more totally from a single source.&quot; Tomalin and Hall worked for the newspaper, the London Sunday Times, that had organized and sponsored the race, and were granted exclusive access to Crowhurst&apos;s writings and log books. Stone pointed out that his knowledge of Crowhurst&apos;s deception went as far back as the original press reports -- from 1969, not, as he claimed, 1968 -- but why does that matter when, as he grudgingly admitted, he drew upon the book for his novel? </p>

<p>
     Mr. Bell&apos;s desire to take Stone&apos;s side on every matter extends in this case to reading only Stone&apos;s half of the correspondence. He repeats Stone&apos;s misquotation, in an essay in the Times Literary Supplement, of a comment by Ron Hall, even though Hall corrected him at the time. And as well as omitting the more damning evidence, Mr. Bell takes a cheap shot by saying that Tomalin&apos;s death had given him &quot;something of a hero&apos;s aura&quot; as well as making groundless reference to the involvement of the &quot;British gutter press.&quot; Neither heroization nor mud-slinging proved necessary. The facts were more than enough. </p>
<p>
     It&apos;s typical of Mr. Bell&apos;s hagiographic tendencies that he quotes Kesey&apos;s assessment that Stone saw &quot;sinister forces behind every Oreo cookie&quot; and then imputes dubious motives to Stone&apos;s critics in this open-and-shut case. And Mr. Bell reveals himself to be somewhat of the Stone mindset when he speculates that James Wood&apos;s &quot;persnickety&quot; 1997 New York Times piece about Stone might have been more British revenge for &quot;Outerbridge Reach.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Bell is so consumed with praising Stone&apos;s novels and defending his integrity that he makes too little of his late-blossoming career as a writer of book reviews and short stories. The series of literary essays that Stone contributed to the New York Review of Books -- all but omitted from &quot;The Eye You See With&quot; -- reveal a personable lightness, buoyancy of phrase and appetite for knotty nuance too frequently lacking elsewhere. And while his novels read like acts of evasion -- an attempt to sublimate his existential unease into portraits of noble failed heroics -- stories such as &quot;Absence of Mercy&quot; and &quot;Helping&quot; feel raw and potent, direct in their confrontation with Stone&apos;s travails: orphanhood, alcoholism, the pain that survives even tried-and-tested forms of avoidance and self-numbing. It&apos;s an irony both regrettable and unmissable that the only services that Stone&apos;s devoted friend and fan has neglected to render are those that might provide strongest support for the grand claims being made on his behalf. </p>

Books: A Life in Eclipse -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Marcia Bartusiak </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     E, architect of the modern universe, called her &quot;the best man at Harvard, &quot; a decided compliment for a woman in the 1920s. Indeed, if Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin had been born the opposite sex, she would surely have been offered a professorship shortly after completing her exceptional Ph.D. dissertation in astronomy. Instead, Harvard officials waited more than three decades before bestowing that honor. </p>
<p>
     But Payne-Gaposchkin belongs in the scientific pantheon. She was one of the first astronomers to apply the new laws of atomic physics to astronomical bodies and in 1925 uncovered the first hint that hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. This was an astounding discovery that echoes down the corridors of astronomy to this day. Here is the fuel for a star&apos;s persistent burning; here is the gaseous tracer that enables radio astronomers to probe a long-hidden universe; here is debris from the first few minutes of the universe&apos;s creation in a big bang. </p>
<p>
     That is why &quot;What Stars Are Made Of&quot; is a welcome addition to the astronomical literature. Other histories have included a chapter or two on Payne-Gaposchkin&apos;s work; her daughter, Katherine Haramundanis, had her mother&apos;s memoir published nearly 40 years ago. But Donovan Moore, a former newspaper reporter and television producer, has produced the first full-length biography, a beautifully written and well-researched study. Handling the science with a light but deft touch, Mr. Moore primarily focuses on this astronomer&apos;s personal life, the office politics and the struggles one woman of science faced in the first half of the 20th century. </p>
<p>
     Born in 1900, the eldest of three siblings, Cecilia Helena Payne grew up in the Buckinghamshire village of Wendover and later London. Tall, broad-shouldered and often dowdily attired, she was teased for being the smartest student in the class, years ahead of her peers. Her school&apos;s chemistry lab became her chapel, &quot;where she would steal away, alone, to conduct her own worship service,&quot; writes Mr. Moore. Though painfully shy, she was still immensely curious, stubborn and willful. Kicked out of one school, she found another that encouraged her scientific interests and helped her gain a scholarship to Cambridge University. </p>
<p>
     Cambridge, then the world&apos;s mecca of science, had always been her goal, and the year she arrived on campus -- 1919 -- was crucial to her fate. Originally intending to major in botany, Payne chanced upon a ticket to hear British astronomer Arthur Eddington announce the results of his historic solar-eclipse expedition, which confirmed Einstein&apos;s general theory of relativity. The event, she later recalled, was a &quot;thunderclap&quot; that encouraged her to switch majors to physics. </p>
<p>
     As she neared graduation, though, she knew that her only career choice in Great Britain would be school teaching. A sympathetic Cambridge astronomer suggested she go to the female-friendly Harvard College Observatory, where a bevy of women -- called &quot;computers&quot; -- were cataloging and analyzing astronomy&apos;s greatest collection of photographic plates. Payne wrote a heartfelt letter to the observatory&apos;s director, Harlow Shapley, and secured a fellowship. It didn&apos;t hurt that one of her letters of recommendation stated that &quot;she would not want to run away after a few years training to get married.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In the fall of 1923, she arrived in Massachusetts with a plan: She would use Harvard&apos;s hundreds of thousands of plates to verify a new equation, developed by Indian physicist Meghnad Saha, that related a star&apos;s temperature and pressure to the wavelengths of light it radiates. More than that, she wanted to compute the relative abundances of various elements found in the atmosphere of stars. </p>
<p>
     It was grueling and tedious work, with her chain-smoking all the way. She pored over the photos for months, &quot;collecting and classifying the celestial flora&quot; and trying to interpret smeary spectral lines, while Shapley pressured her to produce results. Silicon was her savior; she was able to make out how this element ionized in four stages, allowing her to calculate the temperature of hotter stars. From there, she began to work on abundances, which led to an infamous snag. </p>
<p>
     Helium appeared to be a thousand times more plentiful in the stars than expected. Worse than that, hydrogen was a million times more abundant than predicted. &quot;She was treading on treacherous ground,&quot; writes Mr. Moore. &quot;The astronomy establishment at the time held a common strong opinion that the composition of all celestial bodies was similar. . . . that the sun and stars were composed of the same elements on earth, with the same relative abundance.&quot; On our world, free hydrogen and helium are very scarce. </p>
<p>
     Reviewing her manuscript, Princeton astronomer Henry Norris Russell, then the dean of American astronomy, said her conclusion was &quot;impossible.&quot; To save her career, she backed down, editing her dissertation to say that her hydrogen and helium results were likely &quot;spurious.&quot; Ironically, it was Russell, using another method, who finally convinced the astronomical community four years later that hydrogen was indeed the prime element in the cosmos (and long got the credit for it). </p>
<p>
     Even though Payne had written what has been described as &quot;the most brilliant thesis ever written in astronomy,&quot; Shapley promoted Payne merely to technical assistant with little pay. And yet she was still required to teach like a professor. She acquiesced because she wanted to stay at Harvard, for it was there that this shy woman began to broaden her horizons both professionally and socially. </p>
<p>
     In 1933, during a trip to Europe, she met the Russian astronomer Sergei Gaposchkin, then stateless and living under the threat of Nazi persecution. Taking pity, she campaigned to get him a job at Harvard. Three months after his arrival, they married. And by 1940 they had three children, who were often found running through the observatory offices. Together the couple worked on variable stars, although there were no more great breakthroughs for her. Sergei, flamboyant and quirky, was far less accomplished, so, as Mr. Moore notes, &quot;she was holding down two jobs -- hers and his.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Her final triumph occurred in 1956, when she became the first woman to rise to a full professorship at Harvard. Payne-Gaposchkin recognized what it meant. Before her death in 1979, she made remarks that still resonate with women today: &quot;I have reached a height that I should never, in my wildest dreams, have predicted 50 years ago. It has been a case of survival, not of the fittest, but of the most doggedly persistent.&quot; </p>

Books: How Nature Finds a Way -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Daniel J. Levitin </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     If you&apos;re over about 20 and learned about evolution in your high-school biology class, it&apos;s likely that there were a number of things that didn&apos;t seem to add up, and that you were exhorted to just take on faith. Random mutations occur, and across millions of births, the story goes, every once in a while an individual ends up with a mutation that confers a benefit for reproduction, or at least for living long enough to reproduce. The classic example is white-bodied moths ( Biston betularia) on the trunk of a tree with white bark -- they blend in and so are more difficult for predators to pick off. After the industrial revolution in the U.K. turned many of the white-barked trees black with soot, some moths that had randomly become black were better camouflaged; soon they were the only ones left to reproduce, and all U.K. moths became black-bodied. </p>
<p>
     As science, evolution is not like a chemistry experiment, where you can mix baking soda and vinegar and see an instant reaction, or a physics experiment where you slam one pool ball into another. Like relativity theory, evolution can only really be understood through thought experiments. But those don&apos;t work so well for larger-scale changes. Why don&apos;t we see more &quot;intermediate&quot; species, such as fish with legs or short-necked giraffes? How could anything as complicated as eyes have developed through evolution? They are an intricate mechanism that requires a lot of different parts working harmoniously together, and in isolation the development of only a few of these parts would be pointless. Many a high-school and college student is left to throw questions like this onto the pile with other unanswerables, such as what there was before the universe formed, or whether cannibals avoid eating clowns because they taste funny. </p>
<p>
     In &quot;Some Assembly Required,&quot; as well as his previous popular-science masterpiece &quot;Your Inner Fish,&quot; the biologist Neil Shubin shows himself to be a natural storyteller and a gifted scientific communicator. This new work catches us up on the latest progress in understanding such complicated cases -- and there has been a lot of it, some providing the kind of hard, tangible evidence that many scientists once thought would be impossible to find without a time machine. But a time machine is effectively what Mr. Shubin and his colleagues at the University of Chicago and elsewhere have found by studying fossils, and by studying the natural variation that occurs in contemporary species such as salamanders. </p>
<p>
     The author points out the very logical notion that not every mutation is equally as likely to occur. There are constraints -- in the structure and materials of bones, cartilage and joints, for example. Consider flight -- many creatures fly, but the feat takes similar form across bats, &quot;flying&quot; squirrels, birds and insects because flight requires a great surface area in order to bring the organism aloft. Yet wings are made out of a variety of things -- webbing between fingers and toes, feathers and the translucent polysaccharide of insect wings. Animals that fly arrive at wings independently, but once they do, the physics of the matter dictates that wings will share a similar form. </p>
<p>
     What about that missing link, the short-necked giraffe? Mr. Shubin describes something even more spectacular: independent evolution of radically different forms of an organism that have been geographically separated. Various Caribbean islands have similar lizards on them. Forest lizards come in three types, with specialized adaptations for living in the canopy of a tree, on the trunk or near the ground. You might expect that the canopy-living lizards, with their big, deep green heads (the color of foliage), would be most closely related to other canopy-living lizards across the islands. But they&apos;re not. Rather, the lizards on each island &quot;are most closely related to others on their own island.&quot; What began as a single type of lizard on a given island became, over time, three types -- on each island, they adapted independently, with evolution producing the same result over and over again. </p>
<p>
     Something similar took place with mammals. Marsupials -- those pouch mammals that include the kangaroo, wallaby, koala and, here, the Virginia opossum -- include diverse species that mimic the forms of nonmarsupial mammals, another instance of evolution independently coming up with the same result. &quot;There is a marsupial flying squirrel, a marsupial mole, a marsupial ground cat and even a marsupial groundhog. And those are just the ones that are alive today -- marsupial lions, wolves, and even saber-toothed cats&quot; once roamed Australia. </p>
<p>
     These findings show us that the diversity of life as we know it is not the one-in-a-million shot of contingencies being just so. The forms that organisms take are constrained by the ways &quot;genes and development build bodies, by the physical constraints of environments.&quot; There is a certain poetry to Mr. Shubin&apos;s account, as when he explains that &quot;the genetic architecture that builds the bodies of flies, mice, and people reveals that we are all variations on a theme. From a common toolkit come the many branches of the tree of life.&quot; You might say it&apos;s in-gene-ious. </p>
<p>
     With so much in the news about coronavirus, we could all do with a better understanding of what viruses are and how they work. Mr. Shubin provides: &quot;Viruses . . . have genomes stripped of everything but the machinery needed for infection and reproduction. They invade cells, enter the nucleus, and invade the genome itself. Once in the DNA, they take over and use the host&apos;s genome to make copies of themselves . . . with this infection, a single host cell becomes a factory to make millions of viruses.&quot; Viruses are not &quot;designed&quot; to be destructive; indeed, if they are too infectious, the host will die and so will the viruses. And of course, not all viruses are bad; some are beneficial. So here&apos;s where the story gets really wild. </p>
<p>
     Scientists discovered a gene called Arc (Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) that is activated every time you learn something; flaws in this gene have since been implicated in amnesia and Alzheimer&apos;s disease. All land-living animals have the Arc gene, due to a virus (a relative of HIV, by the way) that invaded the genome of our common ancestor, about 375 million years ago. Once the virus entered a host, it brought with it the ability to make a protein that enhanced neuroplasticity and memories. Traits can appear in one species, only to be borrowed, stolen and modified by another through viral infections. &quot;Our ability to read, write, and remember the moments of our lives,&quot; Mr. Shubin writes, &quot;is due to an ancient viral infection that happened when fish took their first steps on land.&quot; Viral infection, and later domestication of the virus, is now understood to be a source of these &quot;independent inventions,&quot; such as the weird coincidence that written language appeared more or less simultaneously all around the globe. If you&apos;re reading this while sheltering in place during the coronavirus pandemic, thank a different, benevolent virus for giving you the ability to read. And to remember that favorite song you want to play next time you&apos;re feeling down. </p>

Books: Crises, Real and Imagined -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Barton Swaim </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     George Friedman&apos;s latest book is either a work of balderdash or a prescient anticipation of our current woe, or bits of both. In &quot;The Storm Before the Calm&quot; (Doubleday, 238 pages, $28.95), Mr. Friedman, specialist in geopolitical forecasting, posits two kinds of &quot;cycle&quot; in American history: an institutional one, which lasts roughly 80 years; and a socioeconomic one, which lasts roughly 50. </p>
<p>
     The institutional cycles involve the relationship between the federal government and the states. From 1787 until the Civil War, Mr. Friedman tells us, the relationship remained ambiguous; from the Civil War to 1945, the federal government assumed pre-eminence; from 1945 to now, Washington expanded its authority over nearly every area of American life. </p>
<p>
     The socioeconomic cycles, meanwhile, have mainly had to do with the dominant forces in the commercial sector: private banking from 1787 to the presidency of Andrew Jackson; land expansion from Jackson to the end of Ulysses Grant&apos;s second term; production-focused industry from about 1880 to the crash of 1929; technocratic management from FDR to Reagan; and an investment-centered system based on low taxes and low interest rates from Reagan to the present. </p>
<p>
     Each iteration of these cycles -- in both categories -- has ended in crisis, Mr. Friedman says, but in each case America has reinvented itself and established another period of stability and prosperity. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Storm Before the Calm&quot; is not a work of history but of augury. The big idea: Both the institutional cycle and the socioeconomic one will, for the first time, end simultaneously. This will happen, he believes, in the 2020s. Mr. Friedman predicts economic and political upheaval over the next decade, then a new stability in the 2030s and beyond. </p>
<p>
     Like other works of prognostication, this one depends heavily on a forced reading of history, often expressed in oracular truisms. Are we really to believe that the second &quot;socioeconomic cycle&quot; ran right through the Civil War and its immediate aftermath despite the fact that roughly a third of the economy, namely the South, was utterly destroyed more than a decade before it ended? Then there are the banalities: &quot;Where the United States emerges at the end of the decade will in large part depend on how these crisis points are handled by both the voters and the leaders of the nation.&quot; Ah. </p>
<p>
     If you take away Mr. Friedman&apos;s dodgy idea of recurrent 50- and 80-year cycles, and ignore the ever more speculative prophecies near the end, the book contains real insights. One example: The two problems now bringing us to a political crisis, he contends, are &quot;diffusion&quot; and &quot;entanglement&quot;: i.e., the &quot;diffusion and fragmentation of knowledge among individual &quot;experts&quot; and &quot;multiple federal agencies engaged in managing parts of the same problem.&quot; That sounds to me a lot like the federal government&apos;s helter-skelter response to the Covid-19 outbreak. </p>
<p>
     F.H. Buckley, too, thinks we are barreling toward a crisis, but he sees a solution: breaking apart. In &quot;American Secession: The Looming Threat of a National Breakup&quot; (Encounter, 170 pages, $23.99), Mr. Buckley, a law professor at George Mason University, asks us to set aside secession&apos;s associations with the Civil War and consider the virtues of an amicable breakup. The likeliest split, in his view, wouldn&apos;t happen along the Mason-Dixon. California has a more robust secession movement than the South does, and for good reason: The Golden State is as different from Georgia, say, as Austria is from Germany or the U.S. from Canada. Energetic independence movements, he notes, appear all over the developed world -- Flanders, Scotland, Quebec, Catalonia. The advantages, or perceived advantages, include greater cultural cohesion (good for the right) and fewer temptations to imperialism (good for the left). </p>
<p>
     Mr. Buckley addresses a number of constitutional and philosophical objections to the idea of breakup, but I remain unconvinced that our present animosities match those of 1861. Is the hatred we see in Washington and on social media sufficiently real for secession? &quot;From prominent Democrats,&quot; he writes in an atypically hyperbolic sentence, &quot;there are daily calls for resistance in the streets, and our restaurants and theaters have turned into no-go-zones for people of the wrong political party.&quot; But &quot;calls&quot; for resistance in the streets are very different from resistance in the streets. </p>
<p>
     Ross Douthat suggests that a decadent society like ours has ways of keeping its members, however rebellious they may pretend to be, more or less submissive. The great invention of our time -- the internet -- shames would-be rebels into docility, routes male sexual aggression into nonviolent fantasy, and turns actual savagery into performative outrage. &quot;Some of our most polarized factions,&quot; he writes in &quot;The Decadent Society&quot; (Avid Reader, 258 pages, $27), &quot;are distinguished by their extremely comfortable late-modern lives.&quot; </p>
<p>
     By &quot;decadent&quot; Mr. Douthat, a New York Times columnist, doesn&apos;t mean depraved or morally suspect. Decadence, for him, describes &quot;a situation in which repetition is more the norm than innovation; in which sclerosis afflicts public institutions and private enterprises alike; in which intellectual life seems to go in circles.&quot; In religion, the arts and technology, Mr. Douthat argues, we are simply too prosperous and secure to come up with anything genuinely new. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Decadent Society&quot; engages with a dizzying array of ideas and works. Among my favorite passages are those in which Mr. Douthat revives Francis Fukuyama&apos;s &quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot; (1992), a book so often dismissed by people who haven&apos;t read it that its author deserves, if only there were such a thing, a national apology. Mr. Fukuyama, never the liberal triumphalist his critics claimed, foresaw the boredom and stasis into which Western liberal democracies have fallen. If Mr. Friedman has a cyclical view of history, and Mr. Buckley a fractured one, Mr. Douthat, following Mr. Fukuyama, takes a linear view. Linear sounds purposeful and exciting, but we find ourselves at the end of the line with nowhere to go: affluent, basically unthreatened but also tired and unhappy and relying on stupid entertainments and perverted thrills just to stay awake. Perhaps we need a crisis -- a real one -- to get our juices flowing again. </p>

Books: A Battle Of Tourists And Librarians -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Tom Nolan </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     &apos;Why couldn&apos;t anything just be simple?&quot; wonders Milo Weaver, chief protagonist of Olen Steinhauer&apos;s &quot;The Last Tourist&quot; (Minotaur, 375 pages, $27.99). Milo has recently been head of the Library: a super-secret service hidden inside the United Nations funneling up-to-the-minute information to the intelligence chiefs of the world&apos;s top nation-states. Before that, he was involved with the so-called Department of Tourism: New York-based shock troops deployed abroad who served as &quot;the sharp end of American foreign policy.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Department of Tourism has been shuttered for a decade. The Library has more recently ceased operations, after Milo&apos;s research-only agents went proactive in the field. But some of the former Librarians stay loosely affiliated with Milo; and now a group of terrorist types has appropriated the old Tourists moniker and seems to be stalking the Librarians and their coveted archives. Should Milo and his colleagues go into hiding? Or should they take the initiative and go to battle with their ruthless foes? </p>
<p>
     The Librarians do a bit of both, in a whirlwind odyssey whose action jumps from Langley, Va., to the Western Sahara; Madrid to New York City to Davos, Switzerland. &quot;The new Tourists,&quot; it seems, are a private army, capitalistic in nature, global in scope. To confront this bottom-line juggernaut, Milo and company conceive a plan &quot;held together,&quot; in the words of one ally, &quot;with Elmer&apos;s Glue and Band-Aids.&quot; Mr. Steinhauer does a bang-up job showing how Milo&apos;s team navigates this escapade -- and conveying why any one of them might wish to retire and &quot;get the hell off the potholed highway that was the twenty-first century.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Nick Averose, the ex-Marine and former Secret Service agent at the forefront of Matthew Quirk&apos;s &quot;Hour of the Assassin&quot; (Morrow, 336 pages, $27.99), kills people for a living -- or rather, he pretends to kill people. An independent D.C.-area security consultant, he exposes the vulnerabilities of clients by infiltrating their defense systems and finding opportunities to dispatch them. Instead of proving his point by creating a corpse, though, he leaves an &quot;Indicator of Compromise&quot; at the scene: a &quot;gotcha&quot; note. </p>
<p>
     But things go awry at the site of his assignment to mock-murder a former head of the CIA. As Nick is leaving the target&apos;s home after completing his task, men break in and kill the former spy chief for real. Nick escapes but discovers that all proof of his assignment has been stolen. &quot;I understand if you don&apos;t believe me,&quot; he tells his shocked assistant Delia. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Delia is one of the few people that Nick feels he can trust as he races to expose a conspiracy that has cast him as its fall guy. He fears that even police officers are complicit in the far-reaching plot that he and Delia discern -- a scheme involving the long-hidden secrets of a group of D.C. movers and shakers. &quot;Hour of the Assassin&quot; is written in terse, swift prose as it sketches a panorama of &quot;Washington at its worst,&quot; a place ruled by &quot;the corruption and blood sport of high politics.&quot; </p>
<p>
     John Lawton&apos;s &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot; (Atlantic Monthly, 380 pages, $26), the author&apos;s third novel to feature MI6 agent Joe Wilderness, takes place primarily in London and Finland in 1966. Thanks to flashbacks and trudge-forwards, the reader is also transported to East Berlin in 1948, West Berlin in 1965, Vienna in 1955 and so on. The fractured chronology reflects the patchwork identity of Wilderness: born Joe Holderness and also known as Michael Young, Walter Hensel and all the other cover-identities he has professionally assumed. To supplement his income and stave off ennui, he is also on occasion a smuggler of such necessities as coffee and vodka. </p>
<p>
     In neutral Finland, Joe shows up as a cultural attach&#233; hoping to win Cold War hearts and minds by touring the hinterlands screening British films. His real task is to account for the presence in Finland of a young KGB officer that he knew in Germany some years earlier. &quot;We need to string him out until I find out why he&apos;s really here,&quot; Joe tells some local contacts. </p>
<p>
     What the KGB is really after, Joe concludes, is cobalt: an element the Finns have lots of and the Russians need to make atom bombs. But Joe can&apos;t be entirely certain about his theory. In a series of actions by turns farcical and grim, he forces a split decision: &quot;There are people who&apos;d like to shoot you,&quot; his London chief tells him, &quot;and people who want to give you a medal.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot; -- a witty, melancholy, first-class work -- shifts into even higher gear when it jumps ahead to 1968, with Joe posted to Czechoslovakia in time for the liberalizing Prague Spring. Here various men and women from Joe&apos;s past and present meet, mingle and manipulate, while Joe tries to turn the historical moment to his and his employer&apos;s advantage. </p>

Books: Journey Back to the Leaderboard -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By John Paul Newport </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     If you&apos;re looking for a way to fill the void caused by the postponement of the Masters, originally scheduled for April 9-12, two books that celebrate the wonders of last year&apos;s tournament might do the trick. </p>
<p>
     To refresh your memory, Tiger Woods won at Augusta National last year by a single shot, 14 years after his last Masters victory and 11 years after his last win in any major. (The 2019 final-round CBS broadcast is available on the Masters website.) It was arguably the greatest career comeback in sports history. Woods overcame not just the ruin of his marriage and public reputation after reports of his compulsive sexual behavior began to surface in 2009 but also the apparent ruin of his body. In 2017, at the annual Masters champions dinner, Woods had confided to Gary Player that his competitive golf career was finished. </p>
<p>
     How did Woods turn things around? How did he manage, at age 43, to pull himself together and beat back challenges from the rising generation of super athletes -- including studs like Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson, who tied for second at last year&apos;s Masters along with Xander Schauffele? That&apos;s the mystery that Michael Bamberger&apos;s &quot;The Second Life of Tiger Woods&quot; and Curt Sampson&apos;s &quot;Roaring Back: The Fall and Rise of Tiger Woods&quot; attempt to solve. </p>
<p>
     Of the two, Mr. Bamberger&apos;s book is the more thoughtful and focuses more explicitly on peeling back the Tiger Woods enigma. Mr. Bamberger goes out of his way to be fair, clearly distinguishing between what we can know and what we will probably never know. His speculations about the private Woods, always labeled as such, are informed by his more than three decades of golf reporting and five previous books about golf, including one about caddying for a tour pro. He knows the world of professional golf, and the pressures it exacts, like few others. </p>
<p>
     The crucial moment in Woods&apos;s turnaround, Mr. Bamberger suggests, was his arrest, shortly after 2 a.m. on Memorial Day 2017, on the side of a highway near his home in Jupiter Island, Fla. In a running shirt and baggy shorts, obviously drugged out and barely able to form sentences, Woods was sitting in his Mercedes, two of its tires mangled. A perp video from the arrest went viral. But Mr. Bamberger&apos;s interest is not prurient. His review of that dashcam video, the video of Tiger&apos;s later interrogation, and the legal proceedings that followed persuaded Mr. Bamberger to credit the professionalism of the arresting officers and of the local court system with effectively saving Woods. He was required to perform 50 hours of community service and strictly monitored for a year; he couldn&apos;t even have an alcoholic drink. </p>
<p>
     Might Woods have turned around anyway? After all, the five drugs in his system that morning weren&apos;t from partying; they were primarily intended to quell the pain from his recent spinal-fusion surgery. Maybe, Mr. Bamberger acknowledges. But maybe not. </p>
<p>
     People determined to dislike Woods for his past sins and occasional, above-it-all arrogance, and there are many, will sneer at such empathy. But it typifies Mr. Bamberger&apos;s effort throughout the book to look beyond the obvious for clues as to what makes Tiger tick. And he doesn&apos;t give Woods a free ride. He devotes 30 pages to whether Woods, despite frequent denials, used performance-enhancing drugs during the peak of his golf dominance. If so, they may have contributed to the breakdown of his body and his need for a dozen surgeries. He is also unsparing about Woods&apos;s looseness with the rules, particularly in 2013, when he won five tournaments but was involved in four significant rules disputes. Most famously, he made an illegal drop in the Masters that year and signed for the wrong score, normally a disqualifying offense. Tournament officials bent over backward to provide Woods with a way to continue playing, but many felt he should have withdrawn anyway, for the good of the game. Too often, Mr. Bamberger writes, Woods &quot;put his own ambition ahead of the rights of his fellow competitors.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The book is rife with digressions like that, but patient readers will find fascinating gems tucked among them. Woods apparently has a peculiar passion to crush rather than simply outplay those with whom he is paired on tournament Saturdays, a take-no-prisoners style that Mr. Bamberger says derives from his Thai mother, Tilda, more than from his father, Earl. In another digression, he speculates amusingly about Woods&apos;s frosty relationship with the talkative Phil Mickelson: &quot;Earl had theories about everything. Tiger didn&apos;t need to hear Phil&apos;s.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Toward the end of the book, Mr. Bamberger turns to his Rolodex of notable golf personalities for their perspectives on Woods&apos;s recent transformation. The consensus is that he has indeed changed, however imperfectly. The &quot;new&quot; Tiger can still be remote and dismissive, but in general he is more personable, less self-absorbed and extremely grateful still to be playing golf. The 2017 spinal-fusion surgery and Woods&apos;s disciplined recovery eventually relieved most of his back pain. </p>
<p>
     &quot;He&apos;s on a more human level now,&quot; says Rory McIlroy. &quot;When you show vulnerability, it&apos;s endearing.&quot; Nick Faldo, a curt loner in his own playing heyday and a three-time Masters champ, credits Woods&apos;s devotion to his two children for the transformation. &quot;When you&apos;re on a mission, like Tiger was, like I was, you&apos;re at the front of a ship, and you&apos;re creating a wake, and sometimes that wake isn&apos;t pretty,&quot; he says. &quot;Then your children grow up, and that changes you. You learn to forgive and to ask for forgiveness.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sampson&apos;s take on Woods in &quot;Roaring Back,&quot; which appeared a few months ago, is breezier. Like Mr. Bamberger, Mr. Sampson zooms in on various incidents from Woods&apos;s past that bear on his recent resurgence, but he spends far less time poking and prodding them. Mr. Sampson gets why Woods&apos;s 2009 sex scandal offended Golf (with a capital &quot;G&quot;) but suggests that it was a bit overblown. &quot;Woods seemed suddenly to personify something or other, like pride goeth-ing before a fall, or Icarus, or King Lear. Media outlets specializing in the lurid enjoyed a series of feasts,&quot; he writes. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sampson, the author of 17 previous books, including a superb biography of Ben Hogan, says that he personally opposes the kind of perfection associated with both Hogan and Woods. &quot;Perfect is the enemy of done.&quot; That attitude makes for a lively prose style. He summarizes the Tiger Slam in 2000 and 2001 -- Woods&apos;s four consecutive major championship victories -- by writing out Woods&apos;s score in each of those 16 rounds: 65-69-71-67, 67-66-67-69, 66-67-70-67, 70-66-68-68. &quot;That was eloquent,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>
     Messrs. Sampson and Bamberger, working from the same basic set of facts, come to similar conclusions -- they agree that Woods today is far more at peace with himself than he was in his glory days -- but emphasize different aspects of the back story. Mr. Sampson gives short shrift to Woods&apos;s alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and rules issues but offers useful comparisons with historical figures, both in and out of sports, who have faced comparable challenges. Not surprisingly, he is particularly insightful about the similarities between Woods&apos;s comeback and Ben Hogan&apos;s recovery from a nearly fatal, head-on collision in 1949 and his victory at the 1950 U.S. Open. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sampson wryly notes that his book is approximately the 120th about Tiger Woods, which would make Mr. Bamberger&apos;s the 121st. Why do we need these new ones? First, because a lot has happened since Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian&apos;s comprehensive 2018 biography, &quot;Tiger Woods.&quot; Second, because Woods remains so inscrutable. He is a Rorschach test. No one interpretation will do. </p>
<p>
     --Mr. Newport, the Journal&apos;s golf columnist from 2006 to 2015, is at work on a golf-related novel. </p>

The Pajama Dame -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  On Day 20 of self-isolation, it might be time to mix up your look. We suggest a ritzy, retro evening-pajama set -- accessorized with marabou pumps </p>
<pre>
By Katharine K. Zarrella </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     WHEN EVENING pajamas first slinked their way into the fashion lexicon in the early 20th century, they sent shock waves through polite society. &quot;They were seen as scandalous -- flat-out scandalous,&quot; said Clare Sauro, director of the Robert and Penny Fox Historic Costume Collection at Drexel University. Introduced by such rebellious designers as Paul Poiret and Gabrielle &quot;Coco&quot; Chanel, evening pajamas were usually fabricated from silk or satin and took the form of a wide-legged jumpsuit or a top-and-palazzo-pants pairing and perhaps a robe. The eccentric actresses and socialites brave enough to deploy such outfits didn&apos;t wear them between the sheets, but to entertain or, as a 1931 issue of Vogue advised, out to the theater -- if one was enough of an iconoclast. Although plays and parties no longer fly in this period of social distancing, elegant PJs can still infuse a night of hibernation with a sense of occasion. </p>
<p>
     Whether you wear them out or in, draping yourself in decadent PJs has always projected a transgressive attitude. &quot;You&apos;re saying, &apos;I&apos;m not going to play the game the way you want me to,&apos;&quot; said Ms. Sauro. These louche sets signify an uncorseted freedom, which is perhaps why designers like Halston and Stephen Burrows revisited the style during the hedonistic Studio 54 era. </p>
<p>
     Modern women have also adopted the dressy pajama as a comfortable alternative to gowns for evening events (remember those?). &quot;It&apos;s an easy thing to put on instead of a dress -- it&apos;s a bit like a tuxedo in a way, &quot; said New York stylist Kate Young, who has dressed clients like Selena Gomez and Sienna Miller in fancy jams by Leset and Prada. </p>
<p>
     But elegant loungewear&apos;s ability to elevate nights-in matters more right now -- if you heed it. &quot;We put so much effort into dressing up when we go out, but when we&apos;re at home with ourselves and the people we love the most, we don&apos;t care how we look,&quot; said Asya Varetsa, co-founder of Ukraine-based elevated-PJ brand Sleeper. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be nice to change that?&quot; One suggestion: Wear a plume-trimmed pair by Sleeper, and mesmerize loyal pets and digital companions alike. </p>
<p>
     Should some of your Zoom mates think your jams don&apos;t pass muster as a legitimate step above sweatpants, don&apos;t lose sleep over it. Grace Coddington, contributing editor at Vogue and pajama devote, said detractors are probably just jealous. &quot;So many people have come up to me and said, &apos;God, I really envy you, you look really comfortable.&apos; And I say, &apos;Yeah, I am,&apos;&quot; said Ms. Coddington, who wore a pair by Michael Kors to the Met Gala in 2015. She doesn&apos;t care if critics think she&apos;s underdressed. &quot;Suffice to say, I think I can dictate that myself, since I&apos;m in fashion. Every time I need to be dressed up, that&apos;s what I wear.&quot; </p>
<p>
     She currently has more than 10 pairs of sumptuous sleep suits, including a custom, sequin-trimmed combo by Marc Jacobs and a cat-print set she designed with Louis Vuitton. She suggests upping the formality factor by adding a front crease to the trousers and sticking with dark hues. Ms. Young, the stylist, further advised: &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a good idea to look super undone and unpolished and then wear pajamas.&quot; She advocates for glamorous hair and makeup and heels. </p>
<p>
     What gives today&apos;s evening PJs a one-up on those from Coco Chanel&apos;s day? You can, in fact, sleep in them. &quot;I kind of love that you could just flip into the sheets if you have one too many martinis,&quot; said Ms. Young. Ms. Coddington has worn them from soiree to sleep -- she chose that Kors set for the Met in part because she had to catch a red-eye to the South of France after the Gala&apos;s cocktail hour. &quot;I slept in [them] on the plane, and when I woke up, they didn&apos;t wrinkle or anything. They looked fabulous as I stepped off the plane.&quot; </p>
<p>
     SETS THAT SET A MOOD </p>
<p>
     A trio of options sure to bewitch roommates, including cats and dogs </p>

Is Sleeping Naked a Glorious Return to Nature? -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jacob Gallagher </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     LIBERATING </p>
<p>
     To Noah Grosshandler, sleeping nude feels freeing. For three years now, the 24-year-old technology project manager in New York has shed the boxers and T-shirts he once wore to bed to go au naturel. He just finds slumbering in the buff more comfortable than wearing bunchy underwear. And while he isn&apos;t convinced that nudity improved the quality of his shut-eye, he fears switching back would erode it. &quot;If I went back, I think I would probably sleep worse.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Every night, men and women around the U.S. make the same choice as Mr. Grosshandler. A 2018 survey by the sleep-accoutrement reviewer Mattress Advisor found that 58% of the 1,000 participants slept completely nude. </p>
<p>
     According to Dr. Chris Winter, a neurologist and sleep doctor in Charlottesville, Va., getting under the covers naked could enhance your sleep. &quot;Your body temperature changes throughout the night,&quot; he explained, so if you go to bed wearing warm pajamas or even boxers (depending on how hot your bedroom is) your body temperature might start too high. As it ticks up, so will your discomfort. </p>
<p>
     Many of the nude sleepers I spoke with had strong feelings about their bedding. Blake Kim, 27, a startup entrepreneur in New York City, praised his &quot;soft cover and duvet,&quot; which he would rather experience naked. In the winter, he tosses on an electric blanket, compensating for the loss of the swaddling sweatpants he used to wear. Daniel Bernardo, 37, a Manhattan-based life coach, had similarly fond words for the comforter that hugs him when he&apos;s sleeping bare. Comfort and an aversion to encumbrances drove his decision to go nude at night. &quot;I toss and turn,&quot; he said, and so &quot;felt twisted up in the stuff that I wore.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Every time he&apos;d roll over, his shirt would get caught and disturb his sleep -- a problem that&apos;s history now that he rests in the raw. </p>
<p>
     UNHYGIENIC </p>
<p>
     In the winter, Kevin Wang needs his pajamas. The corporate strategist at a New York hospital has a wife who &quot;likes to take the covers.&quot; The armor of his flannel PJs protects him when he loses control of the comforter and becomes exposed to the crisp, sleep-compromising air. Some could say that Mr. Wang, 28, should just turn his heat up, but he says he&apos;d rather avoid that, a decision both the eco-conscious and the budget-conscious could endorse. In the summer, Mr. Wang subs out full-length bottoms for boxers, which &quot;just seem more hygienic&quot; than going nude. </p>
<p>
     According to Dr. Winter, hygiene fears are not mere alarmism. If you took a black light to the sheets of a nude sleeper, he explained, you might detect fecal matter or urine. If those concerns are enough to keep you up in the middle of the night, his advice is to-the-point: &quot;Maybe just put on a pair of shorts or something.&quot; And to that end, wash your sheets regularly. </p>
<p>
     Hygiene concerns aside, sleepers who favor clothing feel that even a threadbare pair of boxers or a ratty old T-shirt can prevent awkward moments at 2 a.m. Neil Straghalis, 49, a San Francisco designer with young children, explained that &quot;there&apos;s often nighttime traffic&quot; in his bedroom. If you&apos;re getting up in the wee hours to deal with a rambunctious kid, you might feel more comfortable in at least a pair of underwear. Members of childless couples, it seems, have no such worries -- several I spoke with noted that both they and their significant others sleep in the buff. </p>
<p>
     Even devoted naked sleepers find that their strategy falters when they&apos;re outside their own home. &quot;If I&apos;m a guest in someone&apos;s house, I&apos;ll wear just a pair of boxer briefs,&quot; said the life coach Mr. Bernardo. That way he doesn&apos;t risk a mortifying, risqu&#233; run-in with his host en route to the bathroom. </p>

Hit the Sheets in A Shirt -- WSJ</headline>

<p>
  Most view nightshirts as woefully out of date. But as more men begin working from home, the buttoned-up bedtime look is primed for a night-to-day comeback </p>
<pre>
By Wilbert L. Cooper </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     IN FICTIONAL tales nightshirts are largely associated with aged villains and lovable fools. Picture miserly Ebenezer Scrooge in his long-sleeve caftan or Squidward of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; fame in his knee-length nightie, a look that led Bikini Bottom dwellers to mistake him for a girl. Show a man (or squid) in a nightshirt, and it signifies stodginess or a cheap gender joke. </p>
<p>
     People didn&apos;t always think that way. According to Fashion Institute of Technology professor Mark-Evan Blackman, men wore nightshirts, without triggering mockery, as far back as antiquity. The ancient Egyptians favored linen ones; Henry VIII liked his made of silk; and before the Industrial Age, U.S. field laborers wore cotton versions all day, tucking them into their trousers during working hours. The nightshirt&apos;s appeal was its ability to regulate temperature in the pre-thermostat era. &quot;It&apos;s a really efficient way of...locking in that body heat,&quot; said Mr. Blackman. </p>
<p>
     While heating innovations in the 1920s helped pave the way for breezier pajamas, shifting notions of masculine style really curtailed the nightshirt&apos;s viability. &quot;We in the West made it clear...that men wore pants and women wore skirts,&quot; said Clare Sauro, director of the Robert and Penny Fox Historic Costume Collection at Drexel University. &quot;There is a certain gender-bending quality to wearing a nightshirt today that wasn&apos;t there when it was common.&quot; She believes this rigid perception is changing. &quot;More men are getting comfortable with themselves.&quot; </p>
<p>
     After years of back-burnering nightshirts, Hanro, a European company that has been creating luxury sleepwear since the 1800s, started making the garment again in 2016. &quot;People were searching for it,&quot; said Ellen Vargo, Hanro&apos;s e-commerce coordinator. The market for Hanro&apos;s hand-sewn, $196 cotton nightshirts, she said, occasionally includes &quot;younger men looking for something a bit different.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Writer J.A. Shapira, 37, is one such man. He bought his first nightshirt a decade ago as a lark after watching &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot; But when he wore it to bed, he realized it was excellent sleeping attire. &quot;I live in a 100-year-old house in Winnipeg, where it can get colder than Mars,&quot; said Mr. Shapira, who likes Derek Rose&apos;s batiste cotton styles, which run around $230. He appreciates that the shirt&apos;s open bottom facilitates airflow. With more than a dozen in his closet, Mr. Shapira believes the shirts are a worthy investment. &quot;We spend so much of our lives asleep. It&apos;s important to be comfortable.&quot; </p>
<p>
     With working at home suddenly the norm, nightshirts have the potential to do more for the modern man than merely keep him insulated. Hanro&apos;s Night and Day Nightshirt &quot;has a half-henley placket and a mandarin collar,&quot; said Ms. Vargo. She suggested it&apos;s well-suited for the stylish teleconferencer. &quot;You&apos;ll look like you&apos;re wearing a top -- not a nightgown.&quot; </p>

Dine, Drink, Drowse -- WSJ</headline>

<p>
  Research bears out what our grandparents said: Don&apos;t eat too close to bedtime if you want to sleep well. Plus other recipes for a solid eight hours </p>
<pre>
By Kathleen Squires </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     A GOOD NIGHT&apos;S sleep is the new kale,&quot; chef David Bouley said recently. &quot;Everyone wants it and it&apos;s good for your health.&quot; He was addressing participants in &quot;The Chef and The Doctor,&quot; a popular educational dinner series at his Manhattan restaurant Bouley at Home. During the event Dr. Youlan Tang, a physician in the BronxCare Health System and research scholar at Columbia University, explained the connection between what we eat and how we sleep. Diners listened keenly while enjoying a meal that highlighted sleep-friendly dishes, such as homemade walnut tofu with walnut dressing, sprouted brown rice with wild shiitake mushrooms, and kombu dashi with clams, lobster and miso. </p>
<p>
     For nearly a decade, Mr. Bouley has been hosting events in collaboration with medical doctors and nutritionists to explore how diet affects wellness. Past topics have included food and disease prevention and food and mental health. Dr. Tang&apos;s presentation is the third dinner/seminar at Bouley about food and sleep. The big takeaways: Doctors say that sleep disruption stems from issues with anxiety or digestion. Epidemiological studies show diet affects both, and link sleep deprivation to a weakened immune system, weight gain, obesity and diabetes. </p>
<p>
     To understand how food affects sleep, you need to understand what happens to the body when it slumbers. Body functions slow while the brain remains active. Body temperature drops; pulse, breathing and blood pressure slow. Muscles relax. The brainstem and the hypothalamus produce gamma aminobutyric acid (aka GABA), an amino acid that calms the nervous system. The body produces and regulates hormones. The stress hormone cortisol, for example, dips, while ghrelin and leptin, which regulate hunger and satiety, balance out. Insulin levels spike, regulating blood sugar while melatonin and serotonin synchronize circadian rhythm, the sleep/wake cycle. Your diet can determine that these functions work normally for an undisturbed sleep. </p>
<p>
     Recent research, such as a 2016 study supported by Columbia University and New York Obesity Research Center, reveals which foods can optimize sleep. In his recently published book, &quot;Boundless,&quot; nutritionist Ben Greenfield devotes a chapter to sleep and diet, with a list of &quot;sleep-enhancing&quot; foods. (See &quot;Zzzlicious,&quot; below.) </p>
<p>
     As important as what you eat: when you eat, said Dr. Charles Czeisler, chief, Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Czeisler has twice presented at Mr. Bouley&apos;s &quot;The Chef and The Doctor&quot; series. Dr. Czeisler&apos;s research in conjunction with his colleague Dr. Frank Scheer has found that eating while following an abnormal sleep/wake cycle (sleeping during the day and working at night, for example) leads to &quot;50% increased risk of transitioning to diabetes as a result of disrupted sleep rhythms and diet shifts.&quot; Dr. Czeisler cited a 2016 study by the University of Chicago, which concluded that eating too late causes the body to &quot;work&quot; the digestive system while it should be resting, causing body temperature to rise and blood sugar to drop too low, shifts that will ultimately disturb sleep. </p>
<p>
     Dr. Czeisler has also been looking closely at studies done by the Salk Institute regarding &quot;time-restricted eating&quot; -- compressing the hours in which one eats -- which Dr. Tang also endorses. &quot;Restricted eating recognizes the importance of circadian rhythms,&quot; Dr. Czeisler said. The study concludes that food intake for the day should occur within a 10-hour window, with the first meal of the day taken an hour or more after habitual wake time and the last meal of the day finished three to four hours from bedtime. </p>
<p>
     So, what does the ultimate sleep-friendly diet look like? Dr. Tang recommends a large breakfast one to two hours after waking, a nutrient-dense lunch and a light dinner, all during compressed eating hours. Dr. Czeisler advises to never go to bed hungry. &quot;If we don&apos;t have enough food, our brains go into starvation mode. You&apos;ll wake up in the middle of the night craving food,&quot; he said. Dr. Czeisler added that if you enjoy a bowl of ice cream, it&apos;s best to have it in the middle of the day to keep your blood sugar in check. And he warned about two major sleep-wreckers: caffeine and alcohol. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Caffeine has a six- to nine-hour half-life that can delay circadian rhythms and increase next-day sleepiness,&quot; Dr. Czeisler said. &quot;Every glass of wine and every shot of liquor takes two hours for the liver to metabolize, and that disrupts your ability to maintain consolidated sleep. It may help relax you, but you&apos;ll wake up in a couple of hours.&quot; His solution: Perhaps enjoy that glass of wine at lunch instead of dinner. &quot;I am not suggesting that everyone become a day-drinker,&quot; he said. &quot;But it will metabolize by bedtime if you indulge midday.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Greenfield, Dr. Czeisler and Dr. Tang recognize that nobody&apos;s perfect and recommend some sleep-aid hacks that can help after indulging in a feast too close to bedtime. Mr. Greenfield recommends a postprandial stroll or taking a cold or lukewarm shower before bed to help cool the body. They all agree, if you slip, don&apos;t lose sleep over it. Every day presents an opportunity to reset slumber-friendly eating habits. </p>
<p>
     Zzzlicious: Sleep-friendly fare </p>
<p>
     In &quot;Boundless,&quot; Ben Greenfield recommends these foods that are easily digestible and can help calm the brain, lower body temperature and maintain a low glucose metabolism when you turn in. </p>
<p>
     Fish rich in Omega-3, vitamin B and D: Salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring </p>
<p>
     Serotonin foods: Kiwi </p>
<p>
     Melatonin foods: Tart cherries, oatmeal, walnuts </p>
<p>
     Tryptophan-rich foods: Turkey, tofu, miso, bananas, chicken, eggs, almonds and milk </p>
<p>
     Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT): Coconut oil </p>
<p>
     Fructose foods: Gelatin and raw honey </p>
<p>
     Magnesium- and zinc-rich foods: Oysters, clams, lobster, walnuts and dark leafy greens </p>
<p>
     GABA foods: Sprouted brown rice, white rice, miso, kimchi; chamomile, passionflower and lemon balm teas; reishi and wild shiitake mushrooms </p>
<p>
     Golden Milk Elixir </p>
<p>
     This delicious drink aids digestion, relaxes an amped-up nervous system and helps you get into the mood for a night of restful sleep. The recipe only yields about 1/3 cup, but that&apos;s all you&apos;ll need for a nighttime nip. </p>
<p>
     TOTAL TIME: 12 minutes SERVES 1 </p>
<p>
     1/2 cup full fat coconut milk </p>
<p>
     1 teaspoon ginger powder or 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger </p>
<p>
     1 teaspoon turmeric powder or 2 tablespoons grated fresh turmeric </p>
<p>
     1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg </p>
<p>
     4 whole peppercorns, crushed </p>
<p>
     2-3 drops organic liquid stevia, or 1 teaspoon raw honey or molasses </p>
<p>
     1 teaspoon coconut oil </p>
<p>
     Pinch of ground cinnamon (optional) </p>
<p>
     1. Place all ingredients except coconut oil and cinnamon in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. </p>
<p>
     2. Simmer until slightly thickened, 5 minutes, then remove pan from heat. Let cool 5 minutes. </p>
<p>
     3. Strain liquid through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a glass. </p>
<p>
     4. Add coconut oil. Sprinkle with ground cinnamon, if using. Serve warm. </p>

<p>
     Happy Sleep GABA Rice </p>
<p>
     Choose your favorite soothing tea for this recipe, enhanced with sweet and tart cherries and crunchy nuts. Mr. Bouley recommends this calming rice as a complement to wild salmon, halibut, turkey, shrimp or lobster. This recipe is rich in B6, which helps support melatonin and tryptophan, essential for a good night&apos;s sleep. GABA brown rice can be purchased at online shops such as mercato.com. Sub in any herbal tea in your pantry if necessary and any small, dried dark berry can stand-in for the tart cherries or prunes. </p>
<p>
     TOTAL TIME: 2 hours (includes soaking) SERVES: 4 </p>
<p>
     2 cups Quick Cooking GABA Rice (100% pure whole grain sprouted brown rice) </p>
<p>
     Lemon balm, chamomile, red clover, nettle or passionflower tea </p>
<p>
     1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil </p>
<p>
     2 tablespoons chopped walnuts </p>
<p>
     2 tablespoons sliced almonds </p>
<p>
     2 tablespoons diced dried tart cherries or diced prunes </p>
<p>
     1. Boil water and make 4 cups of tea. Follow the package instructions to make the GABA rice, substituting tea for water in soaking and cooking. </p>
<p>
     2. Once rice is cooked, heat olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Stir in walnuts, sliced almonds and dried tart cherries, and cook until heated through, 2-3 minutes. </p>
<p>
     4. Remove nut-cherry mixture from heat and stir into rice. Serve. </p>

  The author of &apos;Caffeine&apos; offers tips and truths on our abiding addiction and how it shanghais our shut-eye </p>
<pre>
By Eleanore Park </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     &quot;EVERYONE IS caffeinated,&quot; said Michael Pollan, author of the Audible Original audio book &quot;Caffeine,&quot; released at the end of January. &quot;Until you get off caffeine, you don&apos;t realize how universal that state is.&quot; Well known as a writer on food and botany, Mr. Pollan explored the ways plants and drugs alter consciousness and behavior in his 2018 book &quot;How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence.&quot; His new audio book zooms in on a drug so ubiquitous, many people don&apos;t conceive of it as such -- even though its effects on the way they sleep, or struggle to, are profound. </p>
<p>
     For research purposes, Mr. Pollan embarked on a 3-month caffeine fast. In &quot;Caffeine&quot; he describes feeling &quot;out of tune with the rest of civilization&quot; as a result, not as sharp, less focused. But there were upsides, too. &quot;After a couple days, I was sleeping like a teenager again, &quot; he tells listeners. &quot;It was the only upside I could see, and it was a big one. It was wonderful to have these deep, dream-filled sleeps.&quot; Recently, Mr. Pollan took a pause from his morning routine in Berkeley, Calif., to share his hard-won wisdom on cultivating deeper sleep. </p>
<p>
     How does caffeine affect our sleep? </p>
<p>
     It appears to take its toll on Slow Wave Sleep, this critical brief period of deep sleep that we need to reset our brains for the next day and to resynchronize everything. </p>
<p>
     If caffeine is sleep&apos;s enemy, what are sleep&apos;s friends? </p>
<p>
     Quiet. Cold -- the lower our body temperature, the better we sleep. The absence of screens and stress. Sleep has many friends. Unfortunately, they&apos;re just not present or available these days to most of us. </p>
<p>
     How did &apos;sleeping like a teenager&apos; affect your waking life? </p>
<p>
     If you have a good night&apos;s sleep, you often have a better day. Even the nights that my Oura Ring [a smart device tracking sleep quality] told me I had a crappy night&apos;s sleep, I&apos;d wake up feeling great. I&apos;m not sure how reliable the data was, but my anecdotal report on a good night&apos;s sleep generally foretold a good day. Data be damned. </p>
<p>
     Do you find that wine or any alcohol affects your sleep? </p>
<p>
     A small amount of wine isn&apos;t a problem, but if I have more than two glasses, I&apos;m more likely to wake up and less likely to wake up [in the morning] feeling sharp. If caffeine messes with Slow Wave Sleep, alcohol seems to mess with our REM sleep, when we do the most dreaming. </p>
<p>
     But my morning coffee is such a key part of my day. </p>
<p>
     It&apos;s everything: the smell, the ritual. It&apos;s not just the [caffeine] molecule. Those ceremonies we have around coffee are wonderful. During the 3 months I was off caffeine, I would get my chamomile tea, but I didn&apos;t feel like I was part of the coffee culture. </p>
<p>
     Are there similarities between psychedelics and caffeine? </p>
<p>
     I felt there was when I had that first dose after being off for 3 months. It was pretty psychedelic. Not that I hallucinated, but I felt a radical shift in consciousness and substantially different than I had a half-hour before. It was euphoric, a surge of well-being. </p>
<p>
     What are your favorite ways to get your caffeine? </p>
<p>
     Coffee and green tea. I usually drink green tea while I&apos;m working, which is a very even caffeine experience -- you don&apos;t see that bell curve. I&apos;ll have a cup of half-caff after that. Chocolate is another wonderful delivery system for caffeine and other alkalides. </p>
<p>
     What&apos;s your favorite food to pair with your tea or coffee? </p>
<p>
     In an earlier life, a croissant and a cup of coffee was my idea of heaven, but I&apos;m not eating croissants these days. My ideal pairing now might be coffee with a small square of dark chocolate. </p>
<p>
     Do you have any favorite decaf substitutes? </p>
<p>
     I had a lot of chamomile and peppermint during those 3 months. I also have herbs in my garden. It&apos;s so easy to take a handful of mint and any lemony herb like lemon verbena or lemon balm and pour boiling water over it. </p>
<p>
     Yea or nay on CBD as a sleep aid? </p>
<p>
     I don&apos;t have a big sleep problem but if I did, I would certainly try it. I know people who swear by it, but they also swear by other cannabis products, which are legal here in California. Knock on wood, I haven&apos;t had to explore that yet. </p>

<p>
     Slow Brew: Decaffeinated Coffees For the Discerning </p>
<p>
     GGET Los &#205;dolos, Colombia Decaf: These beans from Los Angeles roaster Go Get Em Tiger (GGET) have a full-bodied, caramel profile that becomes more pronounced as your beverage cools. They&apos;re a nice choice for a pour-over or a drip coffee to drink black, and versatile enough to brew espresso-style for a shot or a cappuccino. $20 for 12 ounces, gget.com </p>
<p>
     Devoci&#243;n Decaf: The decaffeinated coffee from Bogot&#225;- and Brooklyn-based Devoci&#243;n delivers complexity on par with the third-wave outfit&apos;s caffeinated offerings. Thanks to a gentle caffeine extraction that avoids excessive heat and pressure, this coffee pleasantly surprises with a fruity and slightly floral nose and a smooth, chocolaty finish. $18 for 12 ounces, devocion.com </p>

Buy a New Convertible -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Carving out office space in a guest room? Housing grown-up kids again? Try these superior sofa beds </p>
<pre>
By Alexis Mainland </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     &quot;IT&apos;S MAKIN&apos; a dent!&quot; So cries Elaine of a back-jabbing foldout sofa as she vainly tries to sleep in the home of Jerry&apos;s parents. The toll the offending metal bar ultimately takes on her body might be comically exaggerated in this &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode, but we laugh at the truth of it. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Sofa beds have a well-deserved reputation for crappiness,&quot; said Chris Stout-Hazard, who co-founded Roger+Chris, a Nebraska furnishing company, with his husband, Roger Hazard. Thankfully, along with other manufacturers, their firm has reimagined the mechanics and upholstery that made the pioneering sofa beds from Castro Convertibles a marvel in the 1930s. &quot;It was long overdue that someone figure out how to put a bed in a sofa without compromising design or comfort,&quot; he added. </p>
<p>
     What&apos;s out: creaky and crimping coil-spring mattresses. What&apos;s in: &quot;memory foam,&quot; the high-density polyurethane that brands like Casper mattresses turned into a household phrase. Designers have redrawn hulking silhouettes as sleek sculptural ones and charmed apartment dwellers by tucking single beds into cute benches, ottomans and chairs -- like Interior Define&apos;s Charly Twin Sofa. </p>
<p>
     Not all convertible sofas require you to toss seat cushions aside and haul an unyielding, unfolding mattress up from the sofa&apos;s innards. Ligne Roset&apos;s new Clam sofa falls into the category of sleepers whose backs and seats lie flat to form a slumber surface. The Clam&apos;s upholstered hinges serve as arm rests in the couch position, explained Simone Vingerhoets-Ziesmann, managing director of Ligne Roset USA. &quot;As the articulated ratchets do the work to open the sofa into a bed, the scrunched armrests unfold to become the head and foot of the bed.&quot; The padded frame cradles the high-resilience foam elegantly whether the piece is acting as bed or couch. </p>
<p>
     Although Roger+Chris&apos;s sofa beds pull out like old-school models, the horizontal bars in the mechanism feature a spine-sparing bend. &quot;While they provide the same structural support, they drop down about 4 inches...eliminating those pressure points,&quot; said Mr. Stout-Hazard. And because this more-refined machinery needn&apos;t be hidden by a bulky base with stubby legs, the team can transform all of its 50-plus sofa and sectional styles, including the Chesterfield, into sleepers. </p>
<p>
     The Inside, a direct-to-consumer furniture company that&apos;s succeeded by offering a limited number of pieces in 150 fabrics and patterns, debuted a sleeper last summer. Vibrant textiles like Scalamandr&#233;&apos;s coveted zebra-patterned cotton upend the clich&#233; of the insipid sleeper. &quot;We are erasing our collective memory of the pullout sofa in brown corduroy with really fat arms,&quot; said founder Christiane Lemieux. </p>
<p>
     Several factors have propelled the sleeper boom: the rise of small-space living; the (temporarily stalled) popularity of Airbnb, where listings that sleep more earn more; and the growing number of people who work from home -- even pre-Covid-19 -- in an office/guest-room space. Boomeranging grown-up kids who need a bed might further drive demand. </p>
<p>
     Interior pro Alex Kalita, of Common Bond Design, estimates that 90% of her New York projects involve a sofa bed. She favors Montauk Sofa&apos;s Traditional Low sleeper, whose inflatable topper adds comfort to its coil-spring mattress. Ms. Kalita also admires Hans Wegner&apos;s wood-framed sofa bed, a reissued 1954 design. A foam mattress pulls from underneath the seat to match the seat&apos;s height as a bed -- like a less-clunky trundle. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I have a permanent memory of my grandparents&apos; sofa bed,&quot; she said. &quot;I can still feel where that bar hit my back. I always brace for it, but that&apos;s never the reality anymore, thank goodness.&quot; </p>

Rumble Seat: Snoozing in Self-Driving Cars? It&apos;s No Pipe Dream -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Dan Neil </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     HAVE YOU SEEN the video of the guy sound asleep at the wheel of his auto-piloted Tesla Model S? Mile after mile, with his head back, mouth open like he&apos;s having his teeth cleaned. I envy him. </p>
<p>
     I&apos;ve never been able to sleep in a moving motor vehicle -- far as I can tell, no one really does. &quot;It depends on your definition of sleep,&quot; wrote Dr. Robert Pascuzzi, Chair of Neurology at Indiana University School of Medicine. &quot;Not all sleep is the same and if you can&apos;t get slow-wave sleep then it&apos;s basically sleep deprivation.&quot; </p>
<p>
     And yet, at a time when most jet travel is grounded, our fly-catching friend in the video suggests a fascinating possibility: Vehicle autonomy could give rise to a class of high-speed, long-distance, overnight personal transportation. Such vehicles/services could provide an alternative to continental, internodal air travel, either commercial or civil -- what the Germans would call Schlaffenwagens. </p>
<p>
     Imagine not seats but berths, with comfy blankets and pillows, blackout shades and ambient active noise canceling. These teardrop-shaped machines (no windshield) would ride on large pneumatic springs, augmented with fully active and dynamic e-suspension, oscillating like an audio speaker to cancel vertical suspension energies. They could afford to be heavier than ordinary cars, with the structure tuned to enhance the mass-damping effect. Mercedes-Benz showed just such a vehicle at the 2015 CES: the F 015, a big steel cloud on wheels. </p>
<p>
     These vehicles would have to be electric, for many good reasons, the first of which is packaging: A vehicle design allowing occupants to stretch out calls for a flat, open floor plan, typical of EV skateboards. Second is electric propulsion&apos;s wins in noise, vibration and harshness. (You say you need the thrum of an IC engine to sleep by? They can artificially generate that for you. Just take your soma, Boomer.) Instead of chasing fleeting experientials like maximal lateral grip and acceleration, the platform engineers would optimize for silence, stillness and fineness. Third, an EV design&apos;s inherently low center of gravity would reduce body roll, improving passenger comfort. </p>
<p>
     Lastly, range: The kind of battery-energy density auto makers are shooting for now -- on the order of 500 Wh per kg -- will make it fairly easy for sleeper cars to cruise at a whispering 200 kmh and have a range 2,000 km. In this age of enlightenment I&apos;m hoping we will have also embraced the metric system. </p>
<p>
     All of the above is within reach of science and engineering. But our bodies might need an OS upgrade. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We don&apos;t really know if people can actually sleep in moving cars,&quot; said Dr. Mikael Ljung Aust, a psychologist and researcher with Volvo Cars Safety Centre in Gothenburg, Sweden. &quot;They can sleep on trains, and planes, and on ships.... They fall asleep all the time in the simulator.&quot; </p>
<p>
     In 2018 Volvo Cars revealed its 360c, an autonomous concept with four different interior themes, including &quot;Sleep&quot; with a lay-flat bed. </p>
<p>
     But sleeping, Dr. Ljung Aust noted, is a behavior with a staggering diversity in adaptations. To an extent it&apos;s the difference between falling asleep -- succumbing to the car&apos;s various somatic cues, what Dr. Ljung Aust called the &quot;sound palette&quot; of engine drumming, the dull roar of tires, as well as rocking and vibration -- and staying asleep. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Of course kinetosis is a big concern,&quot; said Dr. Ljung Aust. We still don&apos;t know precisely why passengers get carsick more than drivers do. Nor does there seem to be any mantra, opiate, wristband or patch to fully turn down sufferers&apos; vestibular response (equilibrium) or the body&apos;s sense of moving through space (proprioception). </p>
<p>
     In my nuts-and-bolts imagining, the solution might involve some sort of hammock, suspended and actively damped in three axes of motion. Dr. Ljung Aust said all kinds of elastified couches have been visualized and prototyped. The deal breaker has always been safety. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We expect A.I. and non-A.I. cars will share the road, coexist,&quot; he said. &quot;So we cannot compromise on crash safety.&quot; Typically, humans move around in their sleep, some quite a lot. But passengers are safest when sitting with their hip girdle squarely belted into the seat. Part of the reason it&apos;s hard to sleep through the night in any moving car is, ironically, the prolonged immobility. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We created a sort of restraining blanket for the 360c,&quot; said Dr. Ljung Aust. The team also tried occupant safety &quot;leashes.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s going to need a lot more work,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     CHAUFFEURS: THE ORIGINAL AUTO-PILOTS </p>
<p>
     In my 30 years&apos; worth of classic-car shows, auctions and museums, including a decade of guest-judging at the Pebble Beach Concours d&apos;Elegance in Monterey, Calif., I have never seen a chauffeur-driven car that was specifically kitted out for sleeping, in transit. I&apos;m assuming I have just missed them. Such examples must exist, right? Or if they don&apos;t there is probably a very good reason why. My guess is roads. </p>
<p>
     Could wealthy owners slumber on the button-tufted silk divans in the back of their 1924 Hispano-Suiza H6B Coup de Ville? I&apos;m sure they could, as long as it was parked. But as soon as that big, hearse-like machine began clattering down the cobblestones of wherever -- Vienna, Geneva or Madrid -- votre dorme c&apos;est termine. It would be like trying to grab 40 winks on Wells-Fargo stagecoach. </p>
<p>
     The first and most ambitious national highway system ever built was Nazi Germany&apos;s Autobahn, with its thousands of kilometers of meter-thick poured concrete surfaces, broad divided carriageways, and gently radiused high-speed curves -- a veritable interstate to the Land of Nod. I naturally thought of the spectacular 1936 Mercedes-Benz 540K Autobahn-kurier, a streamlined, lightweight coupe that could sustain speeds of up to 150 kmh behind the raging, roaring, supercharged straight-eight. That couldn&apos;t have been restful. And I&apos;ve seen an Autobahn-kurier up close. I don&apos;t think the seat backs even recline! </p>
<p>
     In my book, credit for the first super-luxury Schlaffenwagen goes to Daimler&apos;s former CEO J&#252;rgen Schrempp, who in late 1990s convinced the board to resurrect the pre-WWII Maybach marque as a rival to British ultra-luxury marques Rolls-Royce and Bentley. Mr. Schrempp was the first to take seriously the notion of high-speed, city-to-city executive transportation as an alternative to regional flying. With its airship-like fittings, electro-chromatically darkening skylights, blackout shades, and a pair of sumptuous leather lounges that lay out like business-class seats, the biturbo V12-powered, +600-hp Maybach 62 S still represents the fastest nap on Earth, capable of sustained speeds of 250 km/h, through the night. Getting sleepy yet? </p>
<p>
     Maybach sales fizzled and in 2012 the brand was folded back into Mercedes-Benz to form Mercedes-Maybach. One challenge in the U.S. was the fact that most ultra-luxury cars were owner-driven. The picture is nearly the reverse in China and other Asian countries. One of the apparent vestiges of colonialism is the status attached to large, chauffeur-driven sedans or, lately, SUVs. </p>
<p>
     Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Audi, and what is now called Mercedes-Maybach offer extended-wheelbase versions of their largest sedans with bespoke interiors and high degrees of personalization. Included in the gallery are specifications designed around themes of rest, comfort and relaxation. </p>
<p>
     But sleep, it seems, is the one luxury they can&apos;t promise. </p>

SEC Official Cracked Down on Bribery -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By James R. Hagerty </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Stanley Sporkin forced changes in corporate behavior in the 1970s as a crusading enforcement chief at the Securities and Exchange Commission who cracked down on bribery of foreign officials. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sporkin, who died of congestive heart failure Monday at the age of 88, didn&apos;t accept the typical excuses for bribery -- that &quot;everybody does it&quot; or &quot;it&apos;s the only way to win contracts overseas.&quot; </p>
<p>
     What worried him, Mr. Sporkin said in 1976, was the effect it had on young people going into business: &quot;They are being trained to be crooks, trained to falsify records, trained to pay bribes, trained to file fraudulent tax returns.&quot; </p>
<p>
     His crusade was an unlikely offshoot of the Watergate investigation of the early 1970s. As a &quot;schnook government worker&quot; watching congressional hearings on TV, as he put it, Mr. Sporkin learned of slush funds used by companies to make illegal political contributions. How, he wondered, did companies hide these payments in their books? </p>
<p>
     When he became the SEC&apos;s enforcement chief in 1974, Mr. Sporkin led a probe into slush funds. His investigators found evidence that Exxon, Lockheed, 3M and hundreds of others had made questionable payments overseas. </p>
<p>
     The findings spurred Congress to pass the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, barring companies from paying foreign officials to win business. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sporkin acknowledged that U.S. executives operating overseas sometimes were subject to &quot;shakedowns&quot; by foreign officials. Still, he said, much of the bribery stemmed from &quot;greedy businessmen trying to get an edge.&quot; </p>
<p>
     When companies demanded guidance on how to comply with the law, Mr. Sporkin was dismissive. &quot;We don&apos;t have guidelines for rapists, muggers and embezzlers, and I don&apos;t think we need guidelines for corporations who want to bribe foreign officials,&quot; he said in 1979. </p>
<p>
     He went on to serve as general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency in the early 1980s and as a federal district judge in the District of Columbia from 1986 to 2000. In one of his most celebrated moments as a judge, he elicited testimony by a drug dealer in 1989 about supplying crack cocaine to Marion Barry, then mayor of Washington. Judge Sporkin overruled prosecutors who tried to suppress that information. </p>
<p>
     In 1995, Judge Sporkin rejected an antitrust settlement between Microsoft Corp. and the Justice Department over licensing of desktop software. He argued the settlement was too lenient. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington later reinstated the settlement. </p>
<p>
     During trials, he was known for leaning back in his chair and seeming to stare at the ceiling or even doze. Then he would suddenly strike with a penetrating question. </p>
<p>
     Stanley Sporkin was born Feb. 7, 1932, in Philadelphia. His father, Maurice Sporkin, was a lawyer who became an assistant district attorney and later a judge in the Court of Common Pleas. In a 2000 interview with the Washington Post, Stanley Sporkin recalled his father making a ruling in the early 1950s that desegregated a whites-only swimming pool in Philadelphia. &quot;The whole concept I had of doing justice came from watching him,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sporkin studied accounting at the Pennsylvania State University, where he graduated in 1953 with Phi Beta Kappa honors. Two years later, he married Judith Imber, whom he had met on the beach at Atlantic City, N.J. </p>
<p>
     He worked as a certified public accountant before enrolling at Yale University and earning a law degree in 1957. He joined the SEC in 1961. </p>
<p>
     After retiring as a federal judge in 2000, he joined the law firm of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges. In 2006, the oil company BP PLC hired him as an ombudsman to look into complaints from disgruntled workers. &quot;I&apos;ll call them as I see them,&quot; Mr. Sporkin told The Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>
     He is survived by his wife, Judith, as well as three children, five grandchildren and a sister. </p>
<p>
     His daughter Elizabeth recalled her father&apos;s delight in gadgets, Chuck Norris movies and Arby&apos;s sandwiches. She said he brought his grandsons into his courtroom when they were 6 or 7 and showed them jail cells to impress on them the need for good behavior. </p>
<p>
     He trusted his instincts. &quot;By and large,&quot; he told the Associated Press in 1974, &quot;good ethical common sense will give you the right answer every time.&quot; </p>

A Shot at Olympic Glory Is on Hold -- WSJ</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Kareem Maddox quit his podcasting job to play 3x3 basketball in the Olympics this summer. What does he do now? </p>
<pre>
By Ben Cohen </pre>
<p>
  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 28, 2020). </p>
<p>
     Kareem Maddox was in Poland one day a few years ago when he made two decisions that would change the course of his life: He wanted to work in podcasting, and he wanted to play basketball in the Olympics. </p>
<p>
     One of these aspirations was odder than the other. He already had experience in public radio, and he also had experience playing basketball at Princeton. But podcasting is full of public radio producers. There are not as many Princeton basketball players walking around the Olympics. </p>
<p>
     Maddox aspired to be an Olympian from the moment he watched Michael Johnson smash the 200-meter world record in 1996. He was so committed to representing his country that he once had a brief flirtation with racewalking. &quot;I went for a fast walk,&quot; he said. He just as quickly realized that racewalking would not be his Olympic sport. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There must be some Olympic sport I can do,&quot; Maddox thought. </p>
<p>
     It turned out there was. And he already played that sport. </p>
<p>
     The day he realized he could return to the U.S., continue his career and start another one was the day the International Olympic Committee approved that new Olympic sport: 3x3 basketball. </p>
<p>
     He moved to New York, scored a job at Gimlet Media and produced a popular show as he traveled the world playing 3x3 basketball. He won the U.S. national championship. He was named to the Olympic qualifying team. He subjected himself to grueling sessions in saunas to acclimate himself to the conditions in India -- the host country of the qualifying tournament that was scheduled for last week. </p>
<p>
     It never happened. </p>
<p>
     There are billions of people around the world whose lives were sprinting full speed ahead when the coronavirus slammed the brakes. Kareem Maddox is one of them. Not even the young, the healthy and the most physically fit people on the planet are immune to the severe disruptions caused by this pandemic. Their lives are on hold with the rest of ours. </p>
<p>
     Maddox left his job in January to spend this year preparing for the Olympics in July. Then the Tokyo Games were postponed until 2021. Now he doesn&apos;t have a job, and he&apos;s not sure about the Olympics. </p>
<p>
     &quot;So much of my life has been waking up,&quot; he said last month, &quot;and realizing I need to be doing something different.&quot; </p>
<p>
     What makes this time different is that he won&apos;t be doing anything different. Maddox plans to be doing the same thing -- just for a year longer than he or anybody else could have anticipated. His dreams have been delayed with the Olympics. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I guess I might go ahead,&quot; Maddox said this week, &quot;and start looking for a job again.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Like many people whose dreams require training in obscurity for a few seconds of potential glory every four years, Maddox has a personal connection to the Olympics. His father has been to every Summer Games since 1992, volunteering so he can be around people for the best moments of their lives. He wouldn&apos;t have expected one of those people to be his son. </p>
<p>
     His road to the Olympics started in a strange place. In the summer before his senior year at Princeton, Maddox was an intern at a mutual fund run by John Rogers, a former Tigers basketball player who applied the principles of coach Pete Carril&apos;s offense to 3x3 long before it was an Olympic sport. He was always looking for talent. And he thought his 6-foot-8 intern had potential. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I had my eyes on him that summer,&quot; Rogers said. </p>
<p>
     It wasn&apos;t necessarily for a job at his firm. It was also for a spot on his 3x3 basketball team. </p>
<p>
     Maddox wasn&apos;t ready yet. He went to Europe to play five-on-five basketball in the Netherlands and England. And then he retired -- or at least that&apos;s what he thought. After coming back to work in public radio, he produced shows at National Public Radio stations in California and Colorado, and he became the host of &quot;All Things Considered&quot; in Greeley, Colo. But he spent most of his free time working on his game and tweaking his shot. He was basically producing himself. It worked. He made himself so much better that he realized that he wanted to be doing something different -- which is how he found himself playing for a team in Poland. </p>
<p>
     Then it was time to do something different again. Maddox had years of experience playing 3x3 with Princeton alumni when the IOC approved the sport for Tokyo right around the same time Gimlet posted a job opening for a producer on a show called &quot;The Pitch.&quot; Maddox decided to do both. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I would say that Kareem is the first prospective Olympian that I worked with -- that I know of,&quot; said Blythe Terrell, the show&apos;s former editor. </p>
<p>
     The podcast, which is a bit like the radio equivalent of &quot;Shark Tank,&quot; was a full-time job. 3x3 basketball was his second-full time job. He pushed the idea of remote work to its extreme as he edited tape on international flights and hunted for internet connections in foreign countries. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The team would look at each other and be like, is Kareem in China right now, or is it Peru this time?&quot; Terrell said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I remember one stretch when I didn&apos;t know where I was for a week,&quot; Maddox said. </p>
<p>
     The first time he felt the Olympics were really within reach was when Maddox&apos;s team won the last two U.S. national championships and beat teams with players who had NBA experience. On one team was a guy who played briefly for the Golden State Warriors. On the other team were guys who worked in podcasting and private wealth management. But there are lots of little quirks in 3x3 basketball, and this was a wonderful experiment in what happens when pure talent meets institutional knowledge. The experience won. &quot;It was four guys who were more talented than us, but we just knew how to play,&quot; Maddox said. &quot;And we&apos;re not complete bums.&quot; </p>
<p>
     He was one of the four players selected by a USA Basketball committee to represent his country at this month&apos;s Olympic qualifying tournament, and the Americans were a heavy favorite to snag one of the three spots. Maddox left his second full-time job at Gimlet to focus exclusively on basketball. He wasn&apos;t guaranteed a spot on Team USA if they did qualify, but it was highly probable that he would walk in the Opening Ceremony. He even let himself fantasize about it. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I can visualize this conversation with LeBron,&quot; Maddox said. </p>
<p>
     It goes something like this. </p>
<p>
     &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; James says. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I&apos;m here to play basketball,&quot; Maddox says. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; </p>
<p>
     But he&apos;s not just a basketball player. He&apos;s also a producer. Maddox has been trained to think in stories: high stakes, rich tension, irresistible characters. And his personal story has all the makings of a narrative podcast. &quot;I&apos;ve been recording everything,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>
     He has tape of his first USA Basketball camp, tape of him telling his mother that he was quitting his job and tape of this week as an unpredictable virus ravaged the world and made his road to the Olympics slightly more improbable. </p>
<p>
     He doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;ll do with it. He still doesn&apos;t know how the show ends. </p>

Coronavirus Recession Will Be as Bad or Worse Than 2009, IMF Director Warns</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Stella Yifan Xie </pre>
<p>
     Concerns about the financial toll of the coronavirus pandemic continued to grow as the number of infections globally threatened to top 600,000 Saturday, with the International Monetary Fund warning of an economic and financial crisis exceeding that of a decade ago. </p>
<p>
     Overlapping travel bans and lockdowns have hammered businesses and led to millions of job losses, punctuated by a spike in U.S. unemployment claims to more than three million this week and a warning of a deep recession this year in trade bellwether Singapore. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009,&quot; Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, said Friday. Rising bankruptcies and layoffs could undermine any recovery and do long-lasting damage to the world economy, she said. </p>
<p>
     The risks have added urgency for countries around the world to extend relief packages to ease financial distress. </p>
<p>
     U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a $2 trillion stimulus plan, the largest economic relief package in history. </p>
<p>
     With the pneumonia-causing virus swiftly spreading across the U.S. and Europe, after it was first detected in central China three months ago, governments around the world have ramped up efforts to limit people&apos;s movement and began imposing wide-ranging closures on businesses, restaurants and schools domestically in recent weeks. </p>
<p>
     Increasingly strict travel bans set up by large countries including the U.S. and China have put a dent in global commerce, complicating efforts to reignite growth. </p>
<p>
     Cancellations of major events continued to pile up. The organizer of the Shangri-La Dialogue, a high-level regional security forum in Singapore, has canceled the gathering originally scheduled for June. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York and increased testing. The growth outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second and third most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000 respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to around 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 27,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     The IMF warned that low-income countries will be hit particularly hard given a combination of a health crisis, sudden reversal of capital flows and in some cases a plunge in commodity prices. It estimated that at least $2.5 trillion is needed to contain economic contraction for emerging markets. </p>
<p>
     The Chinese government is also wrestling with the economic blow from the SARS-like virus, first from a prolonged halt in domestic business activities and now from weaker consumer sentiment and shrinking export demand as the coronavirus engulfs Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, the country&apos;s top decision-making body said the government plans to boost spending by increasing its fiscal deficit this year, as well as speed up issuance of treasury bonds and so-called local government special-purpose bonds to support funding of infrastructure projects, as part of the stimulus measures to curtail economic impact from the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The fiscal policy needs to be more proactive, and the prudent monetary policy needs to be more flexible,&quot; said a statement from Friday&apos;s meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, chaired by President Xi Jinping. The government also called for a gradual reopening of shopping malls and markets to boost consumer spending. </p>
<p>
     Lu Ting, an economist with Nomura, estimated that, over the second and possibly third quarters, China&apos;s exports could contract by a total of 30% from a year earlier, wiping out 18 million jobs, or about a third of those tied to trade. To counter the negative impact from the outbreak, Beijing is likely to cut its benchmark deposit rate as well as raise the fiscal deficit target to 3.5% of GDP, up from 2.8% in 2019, he wrote in a research note on Saturday. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 54 new infections Friday, saying all were imported from abroad, bringing the total to 81,394. </p>
<p>
     Other countries in Asia continue to tighten rules on social distancing. </p>
<p>
     Hong Kong banned public gatherings of four or more people beginning midnight Sunday, with those violating the rules facing fines of more than $3,000 and six months in jail. Singapore said it would fine people who violate its social distancing rules up to about $7,000. </p>
<p>
     Australia said it will quarantine citizens returning from overseas in hotels for 14 days beginning midnight Saturday. The effort will be overseen by the army and police, reflecting concerns that some people returning from abroad weren&apos;t complying with self-isolation rules. The country&apos;s total confirmed cases stood at 3,378, as of Saturday morning, Australia&apos;s health department said. </p>

Health Care Roundup: Market Talk</headline>

  2125 GMT - The coronavirus pandemic could change FDA procedures and allow new drugs to get  to consumer markets quicker, Gorilla Trades&apos; Ken Berman tells WSJ. He&apos;s typically bullish on healthcare and pharmaceutical stocks and thinks they can benefit by such potential changes. &quot;People now can see how the FDA works,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s unbelievable that they might have a cure for this but it won&apos;t be in the markets until next year.&quot; (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani) </p>

  1324 GMT - CVS Group had a strong first-half performance, says Peel Hunt, but the emergency-care focus resulted in a fewer small animal appointments--prompting it to shut a third of small animal practices. &quot;We expect this to result in a material reduction in 4Q sales and have a 50% impact on profits,&quot; says Peel Hunt, adding it assumes the market will return to normal in July and making no change to 2021 earnings. &quot;We expect the business to be largely unaffected in the medium term and pet ownership may well increase as people/families reprioritize their lives,&quot; says Peel Hunt, giving a rating of &apos;buy&apos; and downgrading the target price to 1,130 pence. Shares were down 77.5 pence, or 9%, at 776.5 pence. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com) </p>

  0927 GMT - Malaysia&apos;s benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index ended 1.1% higher at 1343.09, with investor sentiment partly boosted by overnight gains on Wall Street, and the Malaysian government&apos;s announcement it would raise the amount of its stimulus package to MYR250 billion to cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Leading gainers include Hong Leong Financial Group, up 4.3%, Genting Malaysia with a 3.7% rise and Genting with a 3.5% gain. Decliners include IHH Healthcare, down 1.5%, and Sime Darby, down 1.2%. (chester.tay@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  0851 GMT - EssilorLuxottica could report an 8% drop in 1Q sales and a 15% sales drop in 2Q, Bryan Garnier analysts estimate, after the optical company scraps its 2020 guidance due to the coronavirus. EssilorLuxottica&apos;s two main markets, Europe and North America, are now being hit by store closures and production stoppages, and the European investment bank therefore expects sales to fall up to 60% during the second half of March and April. Bryan Garnier says the lockdowns could last until mid-May in the U.S., which is lagging two weeks behind Europe. EssilorLuxottica shares trade 5% lower at EUR104.15. (cristina.roca@dowjones.com) </p>

<p>
   The latest Market Talks covering Technology, Media and Telecom. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET. </p>
<p>
  2115 GMT - As millions of people quarantine around the world, the stock of ridesharing pioneer Uber remains way below the $41.27 they reached last month, closing today at $27.28, down 3% for the day. But Gorilla Trades&apos; Ken Berman continues to be optimistic. &quot;Uber is focused on gaining customers,&quot; and will grow fast &quot;once they turn that corner.&quot; He says the personal data Uber collects from its expanding clientele promises to be a source of profits in the future. &quot;Uber is for the long run.&quot; (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani) </p>

<p>
  1350 GMT - The departure of ProSiebenSat.1 Media Chief Executive Max Conze, coupled with the reshuffling of its executive board and pledge to return the company&apos;s focus to entertainment, is a clear sign that ProSiebenSat.1 will address leverage concerns, Citi says. The German broadcaster could potentially sell assets from NuCom, its commerce business subsidiary, to bring down leverage, Citi says. &quot;We were not entirely opposed to Max Conze&apos;s vision for the group but with no attempt to address the financial risk, ProSiebenSat.1 struggled to convince the market of its value,&quot; Citi says. ProSiebenSat.1 shares trade 1.3% higher at EUR6.85. (mauro.orru@wsj.com; @MauroOrru94) </p>
<p>
  1218 GMT - Infineon Technologies is expected to take a significant hit to profitability in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, with revenue projected to fall year-on-year, Bryan Garnier says. The German chip maker&apos;s revenue for fiscal 2020 is estimated to fall 4%, with an expected 10% year-on-year drop in the third quarter, Bryan Garnier says. Infineon withdrew its guidance for fiscal 2020 on March 26, citing coronavirus uncertainty, and the company no longer expects revenue growth in the range of 3% to 7% year-on-year. Infineon shares trade 4.3% lower at EUR13.75. (mauro.orru@wsj.com; @MauroOrru94) </p>
<p>
  1134 GMT - Orange is well-placed to navigate the crisis brought by the coronavirus pandemic, says Credit Suisse. The French telecommunications company is expected to take a EUR400 million hit to its French revenue in 2020, assuming France&apos;s lockdown lasts less than two months, says Credit Suisse. However, Orange could also benefit from a fall of about EUR200 million in commercial costs and roughly EUR100 million in roaming costs, says Credit Suisse, adding that it only estimates a hit of about EUR100 million to Orange&apos;s 2020 Ebitda for France. Credit Suisse cuts its price target for Orange to EUR14 from EUR15. Orange shares trade 4.8% lower at EUR10.91. (mauro.orru@wsj.com; @MauroOrru94) </p>
<p>
  1028 GMT - Infineon Technologies should report a fall in revenue for 2020 amid an expected downturn in the car, industrial and smartphone markets as the coronavirus continues to spread, says Equita Sim. The German chip maker is expected to report a 5% drop in revenue, assuming the car, industrial and smartphone markets suffer respective declines of 10%, 4% and 5%, says Equita Sim. &quot;However, this scenario is not a worst-case scenario as if the decline in demand were to persist, a destocking effect would also be generated,&quot; says Equita Sim. Infineon withdrew its guidance for fiscal 2020 on March 26 due to coronavirus uncertainty, no longer expecting revenue growth by 5% year-on-year, plus or minus two percentage points. Infineon shares trade 3.9% lower at EUR13.81. (mauro.orru@wsj.com; @MauroOrru94) </p>
<p>
  0911 GMT - Inari Amertron&apos;s earnings may weaken in 2H due to lower utilization of its plant amid Malaysia&apos;s restrictions on movement to curb the coronavirus pandemic, CGS-CIMB says. The brokerage lowers its EPS forecast for the semiconductor assembly and testing services provider by 4%-18% for FY 2020-FY 2022 due to the disruption and slowdown in demand for semiconductors. Nonetheless, CGS-CIMB says weaker earnings prospects are already reflected in the share price, which has fallen 40% from its year-to-date high. CGS-CIMB upgrades the rating to hold from reduce, but lowers the target price to MYR1.14 from MYR1.40. Inari shares closed 4.4% higher at MYR1.18. (chester.tay@wsj.com) </p>

Financial Services Roundup: Market Talk</headline>
<text>
<p>
   The latest Market Talks covering Financial Services. Exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET. </p>
<p>
  2119 GMT - ETFs could be the best option for investors wary of stock-picking and unwilling to pay high mutual-fund fees, says Ken Berman, whose Gorilla Trades fund aims at outperforming ETFs. &quot;If you like a sector and don&apos;t have a broker to guide you, it&apos;s much easier to buy a basket of shares like an ETF,&quot; he tells WSJ. Berman thinks that healthcare and utilities are likely the best sectors to invest in amid the current volatility. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani) </p>
<p>
  2025 GMT - Gastrobar chain Bar Louie will move forward with a proposed sale to its lenders after not receiving any other qualified bids for its assets, court papers show. Sun Capital Partners-backed Bar Louie canceled a bankruptcy sale auction slated for Monday. Bar Louie filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in January after closing 38 restaurants and arranging the deal with its lenders serving as the stalking horse, or lead bidder. Lenders, led by Antares Capital, agreed to acquire the chain&apos;s remaining corporate-owned restaurants, about 72 in all, with a credit bid of $82.5M. The hearing to seek approval of the sale is set for April 7. (aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com; @aishaalmuslim) </p>
<p>
  1852 GMT - The Canadian government is preparing new measures to help the country&apos;s oil and gas sector that will focus on getting credit to businesses hard-hit by the combination of the coronavirus pandemic and sharp drop in oil prices. Finance Minister Bill Morneau says he wants to support the sector with government-backed credit to help businesses &quot;bridge through a difficult time.&quot; Details of the planned assistance for the energy sector are still being worked out, Morneau says. He added that the government also plans to offer help for the country&apos;s beleaguered airline industry. (kim.mackrael@wsj.com; @kimmackrael) </p>
<p>
  1710 GMT - The SEC will allow asset managers to support their funds&apos; liquidity by purchasing debt securities in the portfolio, the regulator says in a notice posted to its website Friday. The temporary relief may help at a time when taxable bond funds have suffered record outflows. The SEC staff says the relief covers the purchase of commercial paper, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and municipal bonds. The permission will expire upon a notice issued by the agency, the staff says. Fund managers and affiliated funds must pay cash for any securities they buy and must pay fair market value. (dave.michaels@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  1645 GMT - Lebanon&apos;s GDP will contract by about 12% in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic compounds the nation&apos;s existing economic crisis, says Alain Bifani, director general of the Ministry of Finance, at a presentation regarding the nation&apos;s sovereign debt restructuring plans. Lebanon is currently preparing to restructure over $90B of sovereign debt after the government&apos;s finances were rocked by declining remittances of dollar deposits from the Lebanese overseas diaspora. Lebanon&apos;s banking industry largely froze up last year amid anti-corruption protests and declining investor confidence, which resulted in remittances drying up and freezing the nation&apos;s financial system. (alexander.gladstone@wsj.com; @gladstonea) </p>
<p>
  1622 GMT - Six in 10 Americans say their household income has been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, an increase of 53% from those who reported being affected in the previous week, according to TransUnion. Another 10% of US adults expect their household income will suffer in the future. The research finds younger generations were most hurt financially by the Covid-19 pandemic. The research finds millennials and Generation Z were among the most concerned about their ability to pay bills and loans in the next month. Survey responders indicated an inability in the near future to pay bills and loans averaging $1,031, a 14% increase from last week&apos;s. (chris.wack@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  1603 GMT - Deferral or reconsideration of dividends shouldn&apos;t be a negative for European banks, Jefferies says after Spanish lender CaixaBank took a step in this direction. &quot;We[...] see this as a sensible step rather than a negative catalyst. Current valuations suggest the market is more worried about capital resilience than capital return,&quot; it says. CaixaBank said that it would cut the dividend for last year to EUR0.07 a share from EUR0.15. It also lowered the cash payout for this year to no more than 30% of net profit. The bank now targets a core tier 1 capital ratio of 11.5%, down from 12%. &quot;At current valuations, we don&apos;t see dividend deferrals at European banks as a negative catalyst given the uplift to existing capital buffers,&quot; Jefferies says. (pietro.lombardi@dowjones.com; @pietrolombard10) </p>
<p>
  1431 GMT - Concern about credit markets is showing up in spreads, but that doesn&apos;t mean banks have become untouchable for equity investors, according to analysts at D.A. Davidson. Commercial mortgage spreads have spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic, the analysts note, and the CMBX indexes, which track securitized commercial mortgages, have experienced a selloff. As a result of that distress, banks with significant commercial-property exposure might suffer. But because banks are seen to play a crucial role in tiding over small businesses and corporations alike during the crisis, they&apos;re likely to find strength from other business lines. In particular, their role as a conduit for government-backed business loans will guarantee a critical role for banks during the recovery, D.A. Davidson says. (matt.grossman@wsj.com; @mattgrossman) </p>
<p>
  1259 GMT - Provident Financial&apos;s trading update and decision to preserve capital at this time were sensible, Goodbody says. The Irish brokerage says all of the company&apos;s announced cash-preservation measures will stand it in good stead to weather the effects of the coronavirus pandemic relative to its peers. The brokerage says it will also provide a strategic optionality on the far side of the coronavirus crisis. Goodbody has a buy rating on the stock. (anthony.orunagoriainoff@dowjones.com) </p>
<p>
  1224 GMT - A record $234.6B flowed into cash funds during the week ended Wednesday, according to a Bank of America analysis of data from EPFR Global, the latest sign that investors have been liquidating positions in other assets as the market&apos;s massive swings continue. Bond mutual and exchange-traded funds saw more huge outflows, bringing their two-week total outflow to $218B, while $26.2B flowed out of stock funds as well. (amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com; @AmrithRamkumar) </p>
<p>
  1204 GMT - CaixaBank&apos;s decision to cut its dividend for 2019, lower the payout for this year and target a lower core capital ratio is sensible given the high degree of uncertainty, UBS says. The Spanish bank said that it would cut the dividend for last year to EUR0.07 a share from EUR0.15. It also lowered the cash payout for this year to no more than 30% of net profit compared with the more than 50% previously planned. As for capital, the bank now targets a core tier 1 capital ratio of 11.5%, down from 12%. &quot;This looks a sensible move by [CaixaBank] given the uncertainties surrounding earnings and other solvency drivers (markets, RWAs&#8230;) and the need to prioritize loss absorption capacity,&quot; UBS says. (pietro.lombardi@dowjones.com; @pietrolombard10) </p>
<p>
  0927 GMT - Malaysia&apos;s benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index ended 1.1% higher at 1343.09, with investor sentiment partly boosted by overnight gains on Wall Street, and the Malaysian government&apos;s announcement it would raise the amount of its stimulus package to MYR250 billion to cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Leading gainers include Hong Leong Financial Group, up 4.3%, Genting Malaysia with a 3.7% rise and Genting with a 3.5% gain. Decliners include IHH Healthcare, down 1.5%, and Sime Darby, down 1.2%.

<p>
  2139 GMT - S&amp;P Global is downgrading its long-term credit ratings for BMW and Daimler to A from A+ and BBB+ from A-, respectively, and revising its outlook for Volkswagen to negative from stable, the ratings agency says. The firm expects the German auto makers&apos; revenues and cash flow to take a significant hit as global new car sales decline 15% YoY, but that they have liquidity to cover a production shutdown of at least three months. (ben.foldy@wsj.com; @benfoldy) </p>
<p>
  1943 GMT - Brazilian soybean harvesting and transporting activities are returning to normal this week after farmers and truckers in certain areas faced problems last week when some cities imposed measures intended to control the spread of the coronavirus, according to Gustavo Chavaglia, an official of soybean and corn producers group Aprosoja Brasil. Some towns last week restricted truck traffic through their territory, but after agricultural groups complained, Brazilian authorities have included farm work on the list of essential activities that can continue throughout the country, Chavaglia says.

  1852 GMT - The Canadian government is preparing new measures to help the country&apos;s oil and gas sector that will focus on getting credit to businesses hard-hit by the combination of the coronavirus pandemic and sharp drop in oil prices. Finance Minister Bill Morneau says he wants to support the sector with government-backed credit to help businesses &quot;bridge through a difficult time.&quot; Details of the planned assistance for the energy sector are still being worked out, Morneau says. He added that the government also plans to offer help for the country&apos;s beleaguered airline industry. (kim.mackrael@wsj.com; @kimmackrael) </p>

  1837 GMT - The coronavirus pandemic will have a major detrimental impact on the Democratic Republic of Congo&apos;s mining industry, threatening 60% of global supplies of cobalt, a key metal in electric-car manufacturing, according to economists at NKC African Economics. Mining companies operating in Congo and Zambia, two countries that account for nearly all of Africa&apos;s copper and cobalt output are already contending with export route disruptions due to border and seaport closures amid the rapidly spreading virus. &quot;Although authorities are taking the necessary steps to contain the spread of Covid-19, the DRC faces significant challenges going forward,&quot; says Shani Smit an analyst with NKC. &quot;We also expect commodity prices to weaken further, specifically copper and cobalt prices, which will hinder export receipts&quot; (Nicholas.Bariyo@wsj.com; @Nicholasbariyo) </p>

  1701 GMT - European stocks drop as investors fret over rising coronavirus cases and the EU&apos;s failure to agree an economic rescue package to tackle the pandemic. &quot;Individual governments have revealed recuse plans recently, but without an overarching programme from the EU, there is a feeling there isn&apos;t a huge amount of solidarity doing the rounds,&quot; CMC Markets analyst David Madden says. The Stoxx Europe 600 falls 3.3%, the FTSE drops 5.3%, the DAX declines 3.7% and the CAC-40 sheds 4.2%. Royal Mail shares fall 17.6% after the postal operator said its U.K. business would be loss-making this year and that it may have to cut back on postal services due to coronavirus. Retail stocks are weaker on coronavirus shutdown concerns. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  1349 GMT - Airport services operator John Menzies says it has temporarily laid off 1,400 of its 7,500 US-based staff, most of them on a temporary basis, with enplanements down sharply from pre-virus levels. The UK-based company says it plans to apply for &quot;all relevant grants,&quot; with the US stimulus bill earmarking $3B to cover labor costs of aviation contractors such as catering workers. Worldwide, it has reduced staffing by 17,500, most of them by extending leave. Shares down around 13%. ( doug.cameron@wsj.com ; @dougcameron) </p>
<p>
  1218 GMT - Royal Mail PLC has withdrawn its guidance and won&apos;t recommend a final dividend amid coronavirus worries, but of greater concern is the delay to the company&apos;s transformation plan, Bernstein says. Completing the transformation is &quot;critical if UKPIL is to be a profitable business in the medium to long term,&quot; it says. Meanwhile, Royal Mail has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, and the normally favorable business to business skew in GLS is working against it, Bernstein says. &quot;Risks to the transformation plan are concerning for the long-term prospects,&quot; Bernstein says. The U.S. brokerage has an underperform rating on the stock, with a target price of 135 pence. Shares are down 22.80, or 14%, at 139.15 pence. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  1049 GMT - Royal Mail shares slump 11% after the U.K. mail and parcel courier said it&apos;s backing its 2019/20 guidance, but won&apos;t propose a final dividend and has suspended 2020/21 guidance amid the coronavirus pandemic. Hargreaves Lansdown says positives include the ongoing operation during the outbreak of its letter and parcel business and an online shopping boost, though declining postal volumes are set to hit this year&apos;s profit. The all-important question for the group is how long the lockdowns last, HL says. &quot;Royal Mail reckons it has the liquidity to weather disruption for some months, but if conditions haven&apos;t improved by the end of summer, things become increasingly tough,&quot; says HL&apos;s Nicholas Hyett.

  0958 GMT - Singapore shares extended early morning gains, with the FTSE Straits Times Index closing 1.7% higher at 2528.76 on improved sentiment after the government on Thursday unveiled a S$48 billion stimulus package to counter the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Genting Singapore was among the top gainers, rising 8.1% on expectations that the hospitality sector would greatly benefit from the package. Among REITs, Mapletree Commercial Trust was 5.0% higher, CapitaLand Mall Trust was up 4.5% and Ascendas REIT was up 4.1%. Among other stocks, Dairy Farm International was up 4.6% and Comfortdelgro was 2.7% higher. (justina.lee@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  0903 GMT - AirAsia Group is unlikely to find a silver lining in the near term to help it weather the current challenging operating environment, TA Securities says. The brokerage says it is wise for the Malaysian low-cost carrier to suspend most of its flights until June to cut variable costs, especially jet fuel, which makes up about 35% of total operating costs. TA Securities expects AirAsia to incur a net loss of MYR1.7 billion for 2020, compared with a net loss of MYR303.7 million in 2019. It maintains a sell rating and lowers the target price to MYR0.70 from MYR0.96. (chester.tay@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  0853 GMT - The FTSE 100 Index falls 3.4% to 5616.23 as investors retreat to the sidelines amid fresh jitters about the coronavirus pandemic. BP is among the biggest fallers, down 6.8% as the price of a barrel of Brent crude drops 0.5% to $28.51. Other major losers include travel, financial and construction stocks such as cruise operator Carnival, asset manager Standard Life Aberdeen and home-builder Persimmon. &quot;The [coronavirus] numbers we&apos;re getting from the U.S., which now has more cases than China or Italy, are getting uglier by the day,&quot; says Craig Erlam at financial-trading firm Oanda. &quot;It therefore strikes me as quite sensible to take some profit off the table and see how the weekend goes.&quot; (philip.waller@wsj.com) </p>

   The latest Market Talks covering Energy and Utilities. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET. </p>
<p>
  1938 EST [Dow Jones] -- U.S. shale driller Whiting Petroleum Corp. says it has drawn $650 million from its credit facility and is exploring options to improve its capital structure, as some debt maturities approach. The Denver oil producer, which didn&apos;t respond to requests for comment, has $262 million in debt maturing Wednesday and $774 million maturing in March 2021, according to Moody&apos;s Investors Service. The firm, which primarily drills in North Dakota and Colorado, said Friday it has engaged bondholders to discuss its options, while some bondholders have engaged legal and financial advisers. Last week, Moody&apos;s noted Whiting&apos;s lenders may reduce its borrowing base following a drop in energy prices, which could lead to a liquidity squeeze for the company. The withdrawal from its $2 billion credit facility was made &quot;in light of the extreme volatility in the capital markets and the uncertain outlook for commodity prices and the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic,&quot; Chief Executive Bradley Holly said in a statement. (Collin.eaton@wsj.com; @collineatonhc) </p>
<p>
  2119 GMT - ETFs could be the best option for investors wary of stock-picking and unwilling to pay high mutual-fund fees, says Ken Berman, whose Gorilla Trades fund aims at outperforming ETFs. &quot;If you like a sector and don&apos;t have a broker to guide you, it&apos;s much easier to buy a basket of shares like an ETF,&quot; he tells WSJ. Berman thinks that healthcare and utilities are likely the best sectors to invest in amid the current volatility. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani) </p>
<p>
  1906 GMT - Ethanol plants are idling in reaction to coronavirus&apos; effect on ethanol fuel demand--but once the crisis subsides and quarantines are lifted, the US ethanol industry may find itself more balanced. &quot;Once plants are down and they&apos;re called idled, bringing them back is a different case,&quot; says Pacific Ethanol CEO Neil Koehler during an earnings call Friday. &quot;And I think that there is a reasonable expectation that we will see a more balanced market coming out of this crisis.&quot; Pacific Ethanol reported a net loss of $90M for the full year, with net revenue of $1.42B, slightly down from $1.51B in the previous year.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau says he wants to support the sector with government-backed credit to help businesses &quot;bridge through a difficult time.&quot; Details of the planned assistance for the energy sector are still being worked out, Morneau says. He added that the government also plans to offer help for the country&apos;s beleaguered airline industry. (kim.mackrael@wsj.com; @kimmackrael) </p>
<p>
  1821 GMT - Quarantine orders by states across the country due to coronavirus are expected to cut ethanol consumption by drivers by over 50%, says Pacific Ethanol CEO Neil Koehler in an earnings call Friday. As a result, Pacific Ethanol is cutting production by 60% by the end of March to adjust to the sudden drop in demand, Koehler says. Traders and analysts believe that the cut in ethanol production by Pacific Ethanol and other producers will cut domestic corn consumption by as much as 400M bushels--a factor pushing corn futures on the CBOT down Friday. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais) </p>
<p>
  1714 GMT - Weir Group is vulnerable to lower investment in the shale-oil and gas industry, Citigroup says, cutting its recommendation to neutral from buy and its price target to 840 pence from 1350p. &quot;Weir&apos;s exposure to shale leaves it exposed to what we expect will be pronounced spending cuts in that space,&quot; Citi analyst Edward Maravanyika says. &quot;Furthermore, its intention to exit oil &amp; gas and become a purely mining-focused play, announced at FY19 results on Feb. 12, will now likely take longer to achieve.&quot; Shares fall 6.7% to 695p. (philip.waller@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  1459 GMT - Oil shares drop alongside crude prices amid pressure over the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic as well as Saudi Arabia&apos;s move to increase production. BP, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and Total are all lower as the price of a barrel of Brent crude retreats 4.4% to $27.37. Oil stockpiles around the world have increased as major refineries in core markets such as China were shut down due to the pandemic. &quot;According to industry reports, oil-storage levels globally have already reached 75% of capacity, and continued stockpiling under closed demand would crash the prices to $10 in the coming months unless industrial activity restarts,&quot; says Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments. (philip.waller@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  1437 GMT - Shares in SSE fall 9.8% after the energy group predicted adjusted earnings at the lower end of its previous guided range, despite having avoided a material impact from the coronavirus pandemic so far. RBC Capital Markets, which has a sector-perform rating on SSE, highlights that earnings-per-share guidance is now at the bottom end of the previously indicted 83-88p/share range before any Covid-19-related effect. RBC also points to SSE&apos;s comment that it could re-schedule dividend payments if the coronavirus were to hit its business. &quot;Today&apos;s statement will likely be taken as a negative by investors, with most concern centered on the visibility of future dividends,&quot; RBC&apos;s John Musk says. (philip.waller@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  1312 GMT - Corn futures on the CBOT drop again overnight, falling 0.5% as oil prices continue to weaken--with WTI crude down 3% to below $22 per barrel. &quot;The impact on the price of ethanol has been swift and severe,&quot; says Scott Irwin of the University of Illinois. &quot;The price of ethanol at the Iowa plant level has declined $0.32 per gallon, or 26 percent, since late February.&quot; The closure of ethanol plants has been a key concern for traders, with demand destruction pushing corn futures down. Meanwhile, soybean and wheat futures trade higher overnight, with soybeans up 0.3% and wheat gaining 2%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais) </p>
<p>
  1053 GMT - In a pre-close trading statement, SSE confirmed the 80-pence dividend for fiscal 2020 but warned that the &quot;quantum and timing of dividend payments in relation to 2020/21 will be taken in light of the extent of the impact&quot; from the coronavirus pandemic. Citi&apos;s Jenny Ping says this uncertainty comes as a surprise and might worry some investors. The analyst sees SSE&apos;s retail unit most exposed to the pandemic, as it could hit volumes and drive up bad debt. Shares fall 5.6% to 1,314 pence. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com) </p>
<p>
  0853 GMT - The FTSE 100 Index falls 3.4% to 5616.23 as investors retreat to the sidelines amid fresh jitters about the coronavirus pandemic. BP is among the biggest fallers, down 6.8% as the price of a barrel of Brent crude drops 0.5% to $28.51.

Economic Fallout Grows as Coronavirus Cases Pass 600,000</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Stella Yifan Xie </pre>
<p>
     Concerns about the financial toll of the coronavirus pandemic continued to grow as the number of infections globally topped 600,000 Saturday, with the International Monetary Fund warning of an economic and financial crisis exceeding that of a decade ago. </p>
<p>
     Overlapping travel bans and lockdowns have hammered businesses and led to millions of job losses, punctuated by a spike in U.S. unemployment claims to more than three million this week and a warning of a deep recession this year in trade bellwether Singapore. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009,&quot; Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, said Friday. Rising bankruptcies and layoffs could undermine any recovery and do long-lasting damage to the world economy, she said. </p>
<p>
     The risks have added urgency for countries around the world to extend relief packages to ease financial distress. </p>
<p>
     U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a $2 trillion stimulus plan, the largest economic relief package in history. </p>
<p>
     With the pneumonia-causing virus swiftly spreading across the U.S. and Europe, after it was first detected in central China three months ago, governments around the world have ramped up efforts to limit people&apos;s movement and began imposing wide-ranging closures on businesses, restaurants and schools domestically in recent weeks. </p>
<p>
     Increasingly strict travel bans set up by large countries including the U.S. and China have put a dent in global commerce, complicating efforts to reignite growth. </p>
<p>
     Cancellations of major events continued to pile up. The organizer of the Shangri-La Dialogue, a high-level regional security forum in Singapore, has canceled the gathering originally scheduled for June. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York and increased testing. The growth outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second and third most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000 respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 27,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     The IMF warned that low-income countries will be hit particularly hard given a combination of a health crisis, sudden reversal of capital flows and in some cases a plunge in commodity prices. It estimated that at least $2.5 trillion is needed to contain economic contraction for emerging markets. </p>
<p>
     The Chinese government is also wrestling with the economic blow from the SARS-like virus, first from a prolonged halt in domestic business activities and now from weaker consumer sentiment and shrinking export demand as the coronavirus engulfs Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, the country&apos;s top decision-making body said the government plans to boost spending by increasing its fiscal deficit this year, as well as speed up issuance of treasury bonds and so-called local government special-purpose bonds to support funding of infrastructure projects, as part of the stimulus measures to curtail economic impact from the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The fiscal policy needs to be more proactive, and the prudent monetary policy needs to be more flexible,&quot; said a statement from Friday&apos;s meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, chaired by President Xi Jinping. The government also called for a gradual reopening of shopping malls and markets to boost consumer spending. </p>
<p>
     Lu Ting, an economist with Nomura, estimated that, over the second and possibly third quarters, China&apos;s exports could contract by a total of 30% from a year earlier, wiping out 18 million jobs, or about a third of those tied to trade. To counter the negative impact from the outbreak, Beijing is likely to cut its benchmark deposit rate as well as raise the fiscal deficit target to 3.5% of GDP, up from 2.8% in 2019, he wrote in a research note on Saturday. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 54 new infections Friday, saying all were imported from abroad, bringing the total to 81,394. </p>
<p>
     Other countries in Asia continue to tighten rules on social distancing. </p>
<p>
     Hong Kong banned public gatherings of four or more people beginning midnight Sunday, with those violating the rules facing fines of more than $3,000 and six months in jail. Singapore said it would fine people who violate its social distancing rules up to about $7,000. </p>
<p>
     Australia said it will quarantine citizens returning from overseas in hotels for 14 days beginning midnight Saturday. The effort will be overseen by the army and police, reflecting concerns that some people returning from abroad weren&apos;t complying with self-isolation rules. The country&apos;s total confirmed cases stood at 3,378, as of Saturday morning, Australia&apos;s health department said. </p>

Coronavirus Forces Courts to Experiment</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Laura Kusisto </pre>
<p>
     In Florida, an attorney learned late one afternoon that her trial in three days would be held over a video-conferencing technology she had never used. In Texas, a judge emptied a courtroom to allow a defendant calling in by phone to confer privately with his attorney. </p>
<p>
     And in New York City, a judge declared a mistrial over an attorney&apos;s coughing while questioning a witness by speakerphone. </p>
<p>
     The new coronavirus pandemic has forced courthouses to abandon traditions and embrace long-resisted technology allowing legal work to grind on even if courtrooms remain empty. The effort has frayed the personal connections that build trust among lawyers and judges, and raised challenges for a justice system founded on the premise that defendants have a right to confront their accusers. </p>
<p>
     For the first time, judges are holding trials over Zoom, the online video-conference service, and attorneys are questioning witnesses or making oral arguments by phone. Defendants are pleading guilty without ever entering a courtroom. </p>
<p>
     Attorneys say the measures are necessary to provide a timely resolution for defendants stuck in jail, protect domestic-violence victims in immediate danger and prevent a crippling backlog when courts reopen. They also say the move to incorporate more technology into the courtroom is long overdue and could help cut costs, speed up trial timelines and provide more access to rural areas when things return to normal. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is forcing some of this technology in areas we should already have it,&quot; said Duffie Stone, president of the National District Attorneys Association. </p>
<p>
     But the rush to digitize a notoriously analog institution raises questions about what is lost if jurors can&apos;t observe a witness&apos;s nervous tick or attorneys can&apos;t rely on their personal rapport with judges. Moreover, it threatens to collide with the rights of defendants to appear in person and confront their accusers and access the court system -- even if they don&apos;t have the money for the latest technology. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Some of these hearings can go ahead with video-conferencing, but it should be very temporary, and only with the defendant&apos;s consent,&quot; said Nina Ginsberg, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. &quot;People have the right to a public trial.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Jaclyn Horn, a Jacksonville Area Legal Aid attorney who practices family law in Florida, received a notice late on March 13, a Friday afternoon, that any family court hearings at the county courthouse would be conducted via Zoom or Skype. Ms. Horn started panicking, knowing she had a divorce trial set to start the following Monday morning. </p>
<p>
     She said her client helped teach her how to use Zoom. The trial mostly went smoothly, but one challenge they encountered was introducing physical evidence. They ended up devising a system where Ms. Horn would hold up the evidence for the judge to see and then email it. </p>
<p>
     The judge decided quickly in favor of Ms. Horn&apos;s client, who was relieved. &quot;I wish I could have taken a picture of her face as soon as she heard the judge read off his finding. It was like a 500-pound weight was taken off of her,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Horn said it was a relatively straightforward trial, because the husband wasn&apos;t contesting the divorce. She said it is difficult to imagine conducting a more complicated proceeding via video-conference. </p>
<p>
     Few jurisdictions are conducting entire trials online like Ms. Horn&apos;s, but a growing number are having defendants use a video-conferencing facility for arraignments. Defendants can be formally charged, have their bail hearings and even enter guilty pleas by video-conference from jail. </p>
<p>
     Many district attorneys said these video-conferencing facilities have long languished in jail or courthouse basements and were used rarely, usually in the case of a very ill defendant or special security concern. The virus-related shutdowns are now testing whether these facilities can be a cost-effective way to conduct some criminal proceedings going forward. </p>
<p>
     Attorneys said the technology has mostly worked smoothly so far, though most places have only been experimenting with it for a few days. But there have been challenges. </p>
<p>
     A Manhattan judge declared a mistrial in a sexual-assault trial after experimenting with conducting witness testimony by speakerphone. The defense attorney, Donald Vogelman, said he had a fever last week and couldn&apos;t do the trial in person. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Vogelman said he struggled to hear the witness by phone and ultimately told the judge that he was coughing and feeling too weak to continue. Mr. Vogelman said he is still waiting to hear if he has tested positive for the novel coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     At the Bexar County criminal courthouse in San Antonio, 50 to 100 people mill about in each of the 25 courtrooms on a typical day, said local District Attorney Joe Gonzales. To significantly reduce the number of people in the courthouse, judges are slowly moving to adopt video-conferencing. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Even some of our judges that may be old school are willing to learn,&quot; Mr. Gonzales said. </p>
<p>
     The first was Brexar County Criminal District Court Judge Stephanie Boyd, who said she had her courtroom &quot;steam cleaned&quot; before going ahead. The practice encountered its first major glitch when the defendant -- appearing by video-conference from jail -- needed to talk to her attorney in private to decide about a plea deal. </p>
<p>
     The judge ordered everyone to leave the courtroom and the defendant conferred with her attorney. Judge Boyd said she would like to install a telephone for attorneys to talk to their clients without having to clear the court every time, but otherwise things are now running smoothly. &quot;I think we&apos;ve worked all the kinks out of the system,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Most attorneys were skeptical that these temporary measures are likely to lead to wholesale changes in the legal system. The right to confront one&apos;s accuser and to be tried in front of a jury of one&apos;s peers -- not just over a television screen -- is simply too deeply ingrained, they said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The defendant has a right to be there and take in what&apos;s going on and ask the judge questions,&quot; said John Flynn, the Erie County district attorney in western New York. &quot;It&apos;s important that the jury sees their body language and sees them personally.&quot; </p>

Economic-Stimulus Checks Differ From Past Interventions</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Gwynn Guilford </pre>
<p>
     Americans want the federal government to show them the money -- and lawmakers are eager to do just that. </p>
<p>
     A key provision of the economic-relief package passed by Congress is a plan to send one-time cash payments, worth an estimated $250 billion in total, to more than 150 million American households. </p>
<p>
     The economic effects of the program will likely be different, however, from the similar check-payment programs undertaken during past recessions, analysts say. </p>
<p>
     This time, the money is aimed primarily at helping households keep paying their bills and buying necessities if workers lose jobs or income due to the measures taken to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus. That should help tide them over for a while in parts of the country where authorities have ordered nonessential businesses closed and public events cancelled, while urging people to stay home if possible. </p>
<p>
     It won&apos;t boost economic output, but should limit its likely steep drop. </p>
<p>
     This is unlike past recessions, such as in 2001 and 2008, when the federal government mailed checks to households to spur consumer spending in hopes of fueling an economic rebound. </p>
<p>
     Put differently: The current program is more about helping a family keep buying groceries, while the others were more about prompting it to splurge and buy a new TV. </p>
<p>
     Jonathan Parker, a Massachusetts Institute for Technology finance professor and expert on check-payment programs, said that unlike in typical recessions, slumping demand isn&apos;t the problem. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Given that it is best to stop much of the economy, the goal of payments to households right now cannot be to get people to spend more,&quot; said Mr. Parker. </p>
<p>
     The checks coming this time &quot;are social insurance, not stimulus, he said. &quot;Economic stimulus now -- no matter how large -- won&apos;t stop a big recession.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Under the $2 trillion emergency relief bill that just cleared Congress, the plan is to send up to $1,200 each to most adults, and $500 per child. The Trump administration said checks will likely be mailed within three weeks. </p>
<p>
     In 2008, adults received between $300 and $600, along with $300 more for each child. In total, checks worth close to $100 billion went to 124 million households. As then-President George W. Bush explained at the time, the aim was to &quot;give our economy a boost to help us pull out of this economic slowdown.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Parker&apos;s research suggests that the 2008 cash-payments program directly lifted the economy at an annual rate of as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2008 and up to 1.0% in the third quarter. </p>
<p>
     Another study -- this one by University of Michigan professors Joel Slemrod and Matthew Shapiro and Claudia Sahm of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth -- found the 2008 checks drove around $32 billion in extra spending over the course of a year. &quot;That amounts to a substantial macro boost,&quot; said Mr. Slemrod. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. economy could certainly use such an infusion of consumer demand. A record 3.28 million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week as measures to contain the spread of the new coronavirus doused spending across a slew of industries. Morgan Stanley estimates U.S. GDP could shrink at a 30% annual rate in the second quarter. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We need people to stop working in public and stop consuming in public in order to stem the spread of Covid-19,&quot; said William Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution, referring to the disease caused by the virus. &quot;People are losing jobs right and left -- they need the cash to actually make the payments they would normally make.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Beyond helping millions of households cover rent and basic necessities, the cash payment program could eventually wind up stimulating the economy, said Dr. Shapiro, the University of Michigan economist. Those who keep their jobs will spend less as long as stores, restaurants, car dealerships and other enterprises remain closed, and then can spend more than they would have otherwise when businesses reopen. &quot;If the virus resolves in a period of months, this extra cash would fuel the bounceback,&quot; he said. &quot;That could aid the recovery substantially.&quot; </p>

U.S. Coronavirus Rescue Boosts Capital for Global Recovery</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Josh Zumbrun </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- The economic aid legislation signed by President Trump on Friday bolsters the international lending institutions that are gearing up for an unprecedented bailout of the global economy. </p>
<p>
     The legislation boosts capital at the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the African Development Bank -- institutions that are laying plans for about $1.2 trillion in lending programs to countries grappling with the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The institutions themselves accelerated work on their policy response. The IMF has already fielded requests or inquiries for aid from 80 countries and has said it is prepared to use its full lending capacity of around $1 trillion to support the global economy. The first IMF disbursement, $120.9 million to Kyrgyzstan, was announced Thursday. The World Bank has said it is developing a $160 billion coronavirus relief package to be distributed over the next 15 months. </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has unveiled more partnerships with international central banks to allow them to ensure the flow of dollars continues in their economies. </p>
<p>
     The biggest surprise may be the steps from Congress that fully met all U.S. commitments to the institutions. Members have occasionally been skeptical of the need to support the IMF and the World Bank. </p>
<p>
     The institutions aren&apos;t funded through direct appropriations or earmarks but rather through countries that create borrowing arrangements and subscribe to capital in the international institutions. </p>
<p>
     In the U.S., this requires the congressional authorization that was included in the rescue bill approved by the Senate on Wednesday and the House on Friday and then signed by Mr. Trump. The U.S. owns about one-sixth of the IMF and World Bank. </p>
<p>
     When countries boost their capital and grant borrowing capacity, the IMF and the World Bank can make the loans that, in the case of the coronavirus programs, could total about $1.2 trillion. Because the funds must ultimately be paid back by borrowing countries, there isn&apos;t a large direct fiscal cost associated with the programs. </p>
<p>
     Often, even after the U.S. Treasury makes such commitments, Congress waits years to fulfill them, which can hamper the ability of the IMF and the World Bank to operate at their full capacities. </p>
<p>
     The legislation &quot;will provide capital to the world&apos;s poorest countries and will reduce reliance on bilateral loans from countries like China,&quot; said Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican who proposed the measure providing for the international lending institutions. </p>
<p>
     &quot;By pushing for new authorizations now, Congress can mitigate Covid-19&apos;s effects abroad before they find their way back to the American people and our economy,&quot; Mr. Hill said. </p>
<p>
     The IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank are international development and finance institutions funded by member countries. Collectively they have massive lending resources that they are preparing to make available to countries responding to the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The World Bank and IMF each have 189 members, of which the U.S. is the largest. The African Development Bank has 80 members, and the U.S. is a major contributor to that bank&apos;s capital. </p>
<p>
     When the institutions are fully capitalized, they have enormous resources. At times, however, the institutions have had challenges having their funding approved by Congress, with many lawmakers questioning whether the institutions need the funds. But the current crisis has caused many skeptical lawmakers to recognize the urgency of bolstering the entire global economy. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is extremely helpful, not only for the United States itself, but for other countries in critical need of international support,&quot; said Meg Lundsager, a public-policy fellow at the Wilson Center and a former executive director at the IMF who represented the U.S. </p>
<p>
     &quot;First and foremost, it will demonstrate U.S. global leadership and commitment to collective action to help crisis-hit countries,&quot; she said. &quot;This step will be widely welcomed. Many countries will be relieved that the U.S. is stepping up to lead the global effort to slow further economic damage.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The IMF is by far the largest of the international institutions. Kristalina Georgieva, its managing director, said Friday in a briefing that &quot;it is clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ms. Georgieva said that emerging markets are likely to need at least $2.5 trillion to stabilize their economies and possibly more. &quot;We do know that their own reserves and domestic resources will not be sufficient,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     The coronavirus pandemic has rapidly transformed into a global economic crisis. Money has flooded out of emerging markets with unprecedented velocity. The IMF estimates over $83 billion has been pulled out of emerging economies in recent week, a flow that dwarfs even what occurred during the global financial crisis. Such moves destabilize economies that abruptly lose access to dollars. </p>
<p>
     The Fed has responded by opening up so-called swap lines with other countries&apos; central banks. These instruments allow those countries to swap their own currencies for U.S. dollars. The program was used successfully during the financial crisis. </p>
<p>
     Standing swap lines are available between the Fed and the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank. </p>
<p>
     On March 19, the Fed opened temporary lines with the central banks of Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea and Sweden, for at least six months. </p>
<p>
     The IMF said Monday that it is considering a proposal that would create a network of additional swap lines, possibly through an IMF facility, that would keep funds flowing. </p>

Bringing Home a New Baby -- and the New Coronavirus</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Brianna Abbott </pre>
<p>
     Tamar Weinberger saw her three kids playing outside their home in Teaneck, N.J., as her car rolled up the driveway. The children, 10, 7 and 3 years old, converged on the car, anxious to meet the newest member of their family, a baby boy. But Tamar quickly whisked the new baby out of their reach. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I&apos;m sorry, you can&apos;t see your brother today,&quot; she said. &quot;Just wave from afar.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Before leaving the hospital where she had given birth, Tamar, 33, an allergy immunologist, tested positive for the new coronavirus. Her husband, who had been tested after showing symptoms a few days earlier, was already isolated in a room in their house while awaiting the result. He wasn&apos;t there for the birth. </p>
<p>
     The Weinbergers have had to navigate a new reality, attempting to be there for their children while protecting them, and celebrating a new life amid a pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We need to take it seriously and we need to protect our vulnerable population, but life is still going to go on,&quot; said Tamar. &quot;There&apos;s still going to be happy things and scary things, and there&apos;s going to be unknown territory.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Data on the effect of Covid-19 on pregnant women, newborns and children is scant, and expectant families and doctors world-wide must make decisions with limited information. </p>
<p>
     Tamar&apos;s husband, Dov Weinberger, 34, a physician who works in New York, developed a fever, chills and aches on March 10, after first having a dry cough. Tests for other respiratory viruses came up negative, and Dov isolated himself while waiting for his Covid-19 test result. </p>
<p>
     Two days later, Tamar felt mild contractions. On March 13, a Friday morning, she drove herself to the hospital before her kids got up, not wanting to have a conversation with them about why she was going alone. Their live-in nanny would look after the children while she was away. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Just not having my husband there was so hard,&quot; Tamar said. </p>
<p>
     Her baby arrived that day. The staff, aware of her husband&apos;s possible infection, wore protective gear during the delivery. Dov did manage to see some of it through FaceTime, though one of the nurses had to keep plugging in the charger on Tamar&apos;s phone. </p>
<p>
     Dov got a virtual glimpse after the baby was born. The child, the couple&apos;s first since Dov recovered from lymphoma in 2018, already felt like a miracle. &quot;It was also so happy because he came out perfect,&quot; Tamar said. </p>
<p>
     But soon a nurse came into the room wheeling a unit to isolate the baby, and Tamar felt her face drop. She had told the hospital of her husband&apos;s illness, and hospital policy dictated that babies born to mothers infected or at risk of coronavirus infection must be quarantined. </p>
<p>
     The policy mirrors what doctors in Hong Kong and other places recommend, but is considered controversial because it interferes with mother-and-baby bonding, experts said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that facilities consider temporarily separating a mother from her infant. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We don&apos;t really know what the effect is of early infection on the baby. It&apos;s a critical period for a lot of development,&quot; said Kevin Slavin, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases and the director of quality at Hackensack Meridian Health Children&apos;s Services. </p>
<p>
     After the delivery, Tamar experienced complications and developed a fever. She was tested for Covid-19 that Saturday, a day after giving birth, and spent the day recovering alone. </p>
<p>
     That was the most difficult part of the experience, she said later. &quot;There&apos;s nothing like having a baby and not getting to see him,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     By Sunday, Tamar&apos;s fever had passed, and a team of doctors decided to send baby and mother home together. Then, though she had no symptoms, her test for Covid-19 came back positive, and the family needed to come up with a plan. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If I was positive and my husband was fine, I&apos;d be told to isolate. But we had to approach the situation differently,&quot; Tamar said. &quot;I&apos;m the healthier one. I&apos;m not coughing.&quot; </p>
<p>
     A study of more than 2,100 pediatric patients in China published in the journal Pediatrics found that more than 90% of cases among children were asymptomatic, mild or moderate, but that infants were particularly vulnerable to infection. </p>
<p>
     The Weinbergers strategized: Tamar would take care of the baby, wearing a mask while she breastfed; studies suggest mothers can&apos;t pass the virus to infants via breast milk, which helps build the immune system. The nanny, who showed no sign of infection, would help care for the kids. Tamar would pitch in while keeping her distance. Dov would help with homework via FaceTime. </p>
<p>
     Tamar had ordered groceries online when her husband first fell ill, and friends and family took turns leaving food and other necessities at the door. Her mother bought baby clothes online and had them delivered. </p>
<p>
     After about a week, Dov&apos;s symptoms lessened, and he emerged from his room and held the baby for the first time; infectious-disease experts currently believe people are most contagious early on in the disease and when they are most symptomatic. Tamar, a week after delivering, started taking the kids out for a few hours a day to play in the yard. Dr. Slavin calls the family every few days, consulting them on potential next steps. </p>
<p>
     When Dov&apos;s test result finally came back -- positive for Covid-19 -- he was already recovering from the illness. </p>
<p>
     The family is still trying to keep the baby and older kids separate in case any is infected but, Tamar said, &quot;Now that they&apos;ve met him, they&apos;re dying to hold him.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The siblings also are eager to learn a key piece of information: the baby&apos;s name. The Weinbergers have the name picked out but won&apos;t divulge it until the bris, which typically occurs eight days after birth. It has been postponed until the interaction is safe for the mohel, who performs the circumcision ceremony. </p>
<p>
     Overall, the Weinbergers consider themselves lucky. Mom, baby and kids are healthy, and dad is getting better. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We survived Covid-19,&quot; Tamar said. &quot;And I want a T-shirt.&quot; </p>

People Need Loans as Coronavirus Spreads. Lenders Are Making Them Tougher to Get.</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By AnnaMaria Andriotis and Peter Rudegeair </pre>
<p>
     Banks and financial-technology firms are starting to toughen their approval standards for new loans to consumers and small businesses. That means many people could find it hard to get credit just when they most need it, as the novel coronavirus pandemic puts thousands out of work. </p>
<p>
     Large U.S. lenders including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp., Capital One Financial Corp. and Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. are among the companies reviewing and revising certain lending criteria, according to people familiar with the matter. Planned moves include approving fewer consumers with lower credit scores, asking for more income documentation and placing lower spending limits on new credit cards. </p>
<p>
     American Express Co. has scaled back financing offers to small businesses, according to people familiar with the matter. Fintech lenders Square Inc. and On Deck Capital Inc. said this week they would do the same. </p>
<p>
     About half a dozen lenders that have found borrowers through Fundera Inc., an online marketplace for small-business loans, have paused new extensions of credit, said Fundera CEO Jared Hecht. &quot;Lenders have zero idea how to assess risk in this environment,&quot; Mr. Hecht said. &quot;There is no model that can predict today if I lend $1, will I get paid back?&quot; </p>
<p>
     Lenders are concerned that rising unemployment and a potential recession will send loan defaults soaring. The moves suggest at best a pause and at worst an end to six-plus years of a bull run in credit, where financial firms have been eager to lend and underwriting standards for credit cards, auto loans and personal loans have been relatively loose. </p>
<p>
     Lenders are scrutinizing applications for credit cards and personal loans in particular because consumers often turn to them when they are in a bind. They are usually unsecured, which means lenders have little recourse if a borrower defaults, and they can be the first loans people stop paying when money is tight. </p>
<p>
     Many lenders have said they would work with existing borrowers who ask for help. Some lenders, for example, are increasing card spending limits or delaying due dates on loans. </p>
<p>
     But lenders are reluctant to take on additional risk from new customers. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Even people who applied [for credit] in the last two weeks are more vulnerable [now] than when they applied,&quot; said Brian Riley, director of credit advisory services at Mercator Advisory Group. </p>
<p>
     Loan solicitations by email have dropped for both credit cards and personal loans, according to market-research firm Competiscan. AmEx, Bank of America and JPMorgan have sent almost no card solicitations in more than a week. </p>
<p>
     The changes could be most painful for low-wage workers such as wait staff and hotel employees uncertain when their next paycheck will arrive. Some lenders say they have noticed consumers applying for credit at several financial institutions at around the same time, a sign that consumers are reaching for credit lifelines while they can still get them. </p>
<p>
     To make matters worse, many Americans were already overstretched before the pandemic, tapping credit cards, auto loans and student loans as costs soared over the past decade but incomes largely failed to keep pace. </p>
<p>
     LendingClub Corp., an online lender that is one of the largest providers of personal loans, said last week it would approve fewer loans from first-time applicants, require more verification of income and employment status and reduce approval rates to &quot;higher-risk borrower populations.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;Like many other businesses during this period, we are focused on retaining our best customers,&quot; the company said in a regulatory filing this month. </p>
<p>
     Small-business lenders also are getting stingier with credit. On Deck recently stopped making new loans to movie theaters, hotels and nightclubs. It also made other changes to &quot;significantly tighten underwriting standards,&quot; the company said in a regulatory filing Monday. </p>
<p>
     Last week, On Deck informed LD3 Inc., an auto-transport business in Berthoud, Colo., that its $35,000 line of credit with a 24.9% annual percentage rate had been suspended, said co-owner Debbie Coyle. LD3 had drawn on that line intermittently since 2017, letting On Deck recoup what it was owed from LD3&apos;s checking account every week, and had paid off all outstanding balances by early February. </p>
<p>
     On Deck asked LD3 on March 20 to submit three months of bank statements and a screenshot of its business transactions over the previous few weeks if it wanted On Deck to consider reopening the credit line, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. On Deck told LD3 it had chosen to &quot;mitigate risk exposure&quot; to businesses that had little or no activity on their credit lines in the previous 30 days. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The thing that&apos;s frustrating to me is the lack of support of small businesses that are hurting right now,&quot; said Ms. Coyle, 55. &quot;The whole point of having a credit line is to be able to use it when you need it.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ms. Coyle hasn&apos;t submitted the extra documents to On Deck and said LD3 is weighing other options. Until the effects of the coronavirus on its business were clearer and the company had a better idea how the federal government would be aiding small businesses, LD3 didn&apos;t want to explore additional loans or lenders. </p>
<p>
     On Deck said it placed a &quot;temporary hold&quot; on LD3&apos;s credit line &quot;in accordance with our disaster management procedures.&quot; &quot;By submitting updated financial information, this hold can be removed, and we have discussed this with the customer who indicated they have no need for additional credit at this time,&quot; it said. </p>
<p>
     Square Capital, the lending arm of the payments processor run by Jack Dorsey, made loan offers to some small-business customers earlier this month but then didn&apos;t fund them when customers tried to activate them in recent days. </p>
<p>
     A Square Capital spokeswoman said loan offers are expiring sooner in light of more recent data the lender gleans from processing customers&apos; payments. </p>
<p>
     At AmEx, many salespeople tasked with calling small businesses to offer cards have been told to stand down, according to people familiar with the matter. The company also has reduced its number of loan offers to small businesses. </p>
<p>
     Lenders that make loans to subprime borrowers are particularly tightening standards. Capital One and Santander Consumer are lowering approval rates for applicants who have only the minimum required credit score or close to it, according to people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>
     Santander Consumer also is tweaking auto-lending standards to lend less money in relation to a car&apos;s value -- which means some borrowers will have to make larger down payments. Some Capital One applicants with low credit scores who do get approved will receive lower spending limits than they would have before the pandemic, some of the people said. </p>
<p>
     Synchrony Financial, which specializes in store credit cards, is also tweaking underwriting standards for new card applicants, according to people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>
     Some lenders also are discussing whether they should lower spending limits on cards that consumers haven&apos;t used in a long time. They worry that consumers will pull out cards they have abandoned in drawers and use them to buy items they otherwise can&apos;t afford. </p>

Advocates Argue DACA Immigrants Needed to Help U.S. Fight Covid-19 Pandemic -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
 
   By Jess Bravin 
 </pre>
<p>
  WASHINGTON--At November&apos;s Supreme Court arguments over DACA, advocates for young immigrants the Trump administration seeks to deport contended the Department of Homeland Security skirted federal law by failing to consider some of the interests that ending the Obama-era program could put in jeopardy. In a Friday filing, lawyers for some of the immigrants told the justices that coronavirus pandemic gave those arguments new weight. </p>
<p>
  &quot;Approximately 27,000 DACA recipients are healthcare workers--including nurses, dentists, pharmacists, physician assistants, home health aides, technicians, and other staff--and nearly 200 are medical students, residents and physicians,&quot; attorneys with the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School wrote. &quot;The pandemic sheds new light on the reliance interests of healthcare providers and the public health consequences of ignoring those interests, presciently identified by the Association of American Medical Colleges and 32 allied organizations in their amicus brief.&quot; </p>
<p>
  &quot;The risk of a pandemic...continues to grow, since infectious diseases can spread around the globe in a matter of days due to increased urbanization and international travel,&quot; said the brief, which was filed in October. &quot;To ensure health security, the country needs a robust health workforce,&quot; but the U.S. is unprepared &quot;to fill the loss that would result if DACA recipients were excluded.&quot; </p>
<p>
  The letter cited from the case record several DACA recipients working in healthcare, including physicians, nurses, a paramedic and a surgical technician. </p>
<p>
  &quot;DACA recipients are essential to protecting communities across the country endangered by COVID-19,&quot; the letter said. &quot;Termination of DACA during this national emergency would be catastrophic.&quot; </p>
<p>
  A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. On the day of Supreme Court arguments, President Trump said in a tweet that &quot;many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from angels. Some are very tough, hardened criminals.&quot; </p>
<p>
  The Supreme Court itself has been disrupted by the pandemic, closing the landmark building to the public, canceling March arguments and dispersing the justices and employees to work from home. </p>
<p>
  President Obama established DACA, which stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, in 2012 to provide a renewable two-year work authorization and reprieve from deportation for illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and have clean records. The Trump administration has offered shifting rationales for its decision to cancel the program, initially asserting DACA was unconstitutional and, later, saying it was good policy to deport the recipients. </p>
<p>
  Federal courts in California, New York and Washington, D.C., stopped the administration from canceling the program on grounds that officials had not followed proper deliberative procedures for changing the policy. The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, which has kept the program in place for some 700,000 recipients while litigation proceeds. </p>

Lawmakers Pack Federal Stimulus Bill With Pet Provisions</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Brody Mullins and Ted Mann </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- The roughly $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress provides big-ticket relief to workers and businesses -- and a lot of small favors to special interests. </p>
<p>
     Lawmakers used the opportunity of a must-pass bill to make a slew of policy changes that had gathered dust, some for years in a stagnant and divided Congress. </p>
<p>
     From streamlining the approval process for sunscreen ingredients to giving tax-preferred treatment to feminine-hygiene products, the package is blending emergency stimulus for the economy with small-bore alterations to federal law. </p>
<p>
     In a tweet on Friday, President Trump seemed to acknowledge the need for compromise, including allowing provisions not directly related to economic stimulus into the legislation to get it through a divided Congress. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is &apos;HELL&apos; dealing with the Dems, had to give up some stupid things in order to get the &apos;big picture&apos; done,&quot; the president wrote on Twitter. &quot;90% GREAT!&quot; </p>
<p>
     Buried in hundreds of pages of dense legislative language were dozens of measures added to the bill by Republicans and Democrats alike seeking to advance their own priorities. Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.), tried to delay passage in part because of all the add-ons. </p>
<p>
     Along with a temporary repeal of alcohol excise taxes for makers of hand sanitizer are provisions that would ban companies that receive federal loans from weighing in on efforts by their employees to form labor unions. </p>
<p>
     Community and regional banks each scored wins on separate measures to allow them to reduce capital requirements so they can make more loans. </p>
<p>
     Democrats added language that would ban the use of any money in the legislation to pay for a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and Republicans added a measure to promote sexual abstinence. </p>
<p>
     Some special-interest wins resulted from efforts to keep things out of the bill. </p>
<p>
     Lobbyists for the banking industry and credit bureaus defeated a proposal from Democratic lawmakers that would have suspended reporting of negative credit information to credit-card issuers and banks for four months in an attempt to help laid-off workers who are likely to miss bill payments because of the economic crisis. </p>
<p>
     The industry argued that blocking reports would undermine consumers&apos; access to credit in the future. </p>
<p>
     Makers of over-the-counter drugs, such as Tylenol, Pepto-Bismol and Benadryl, won inclusion of a long-sought bill to change the federal approval process for new products. </p>
<p>
     The industry attached an existing bill to the stimulus package that includes several wins, such as an 18-month marketing exclusivity period on new products. </p>
<p>
     The bill also streamlines the Food and Drug Administration&apos;s approval process for new products, a change sought for years by the trade association that represents companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Bayer Consumer Health and Bausch &amp; Lomb. </p>
<p>
     Tucked inside the FDA bill was a separate measure championed by makers of sunscreen such as Coppertone and Banana Boat. U.S. sunscreen manufacturers won language that halts an FDA review into whether the ingredients of most widely used sunscreens are harmful. </p>
<p>
     Under a measure hitching a ride on the stimulus, the FDA would be required to begin a new review process that allows for more input from the industry and scientists. </p>
<p>
     Several sunscreen manufacturers, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association and melanoma-patient advocacy groups called for the change after the FDA last year initiated a safety review of the sunscreen ingredients using a process they thought was unfair. </p>
<p>
     The changes sought by the sunscreen makers and the over-the-counter companies were part of legislation that had been advanced by former Sen. Johnny Isakson (R., Ga.), a survivor of melanoma who resigned from the Senate last year due to other health issues. </p>
<p>
     Industry lobbyists say that other Republicans added the sunscreen measures to the stimulus to help establish Mr. Isakson&apos;s legacy. </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, other parts of the government are making policy changes backed by industries to soften the economic blow of the novel coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     On Thursday, the State Department relaxed some requirements, such as an in-person interview, for foreign workers who want to come to the U.S. to work on farms. As many as one in 10 workers on a farm are seasonal guest workers who need special visas to enter the country. </p>
<p>
     Dave Puglia, the president of the Western Growers Association, said in a statement that the change was needed because &quot;American farmers are dependent on guest workers&quot; and U.S. consumers are &quot;dependent on the food from these harvests for continued sustenance during the present crisis.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Separately, the stimulus legislation provides $300 million to help the U.S. seafood industry, including commercial and charter fishermen. </p>
<p>
     But seafood companies continue to press for a separate change in immigration policy that would help ensure that processing plants in Alaska have enough workers to handle this summer&apos;s salmon catch. </p>
<p>
     Thousands of seasonal workers now working in processing plants for the pollock-fishing season would be allowed to remain in the U.S. between the end of the current fishing season next month and the start of salmon season this summer. </p>
<p>
     Without the change, seasonal workers would be required to go home between seasons and seafood companies worry that they wouldn&apos;t be allowed back into the U.S. due to the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is essential that the entire seafood value chain be helped,&quot; said Gavin Gibbons, a spokesman for the industry trade group the National Fisheries Institute. &quot;It does no good to catch fish if it ends up just sitting on the dock.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The bill also made a change long sought by lawmakers concerned with equalizing the tax code&apos;s treatment of women and men: adding tampons and other menstrual-care products to the list of qualified medical expenses. </p>
<p>
     That means they could be purchased using pretax funds in health savings accounts, just as the law already allows for products ranging from condoms and pregnancy tests to Band-Aids. </p>

Getting Exercise in the Mountains Where They Can Find It</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jen Murphy </pre>
<p>
     Like many people, Seth Sachson has been struggling with how to exercise responsibly and safely during the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re all on lockdown, but getting out in nature with family has been a positive during all of this,&quot; says Mr. Sachson, 50, the executive director of the Aspen Animal Shelter and a resident of Old Snowmass, Colo. &quot;It has let us feel connected in a hard time.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Public officials are imploring people exercising outside to be careful during the coronavirus pandemic. Crowds recently forced government officials in California to close parks and hiking trails, and Vail and other resorts in Colorado&apos;s Front Range have ended uphill skiing because of overcrowding. </p>
<p>
     Pitkin County Open Space and Trails director Gary Tennenbaum warned on March 25 that if people ignore social-distancing requirements and hang out in crowds while doing outside activities, they will leave public land managers no choice but to take drastic actions. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sachson had logged one day on the slopes this season before Aspen Skiing Co. closed operations by order of Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on March 15. Mr. Sachson&apos;s wife, Bryna Patterson, a ski instructor, is now out of a job. The night following the announcement, his 17-year-old nephew, Jeremy Trattler, intended to fly from Miami and stay with the couple and snowboard over spring break. Mr. Sachson told him to cancel, but his nephew suggested they could skin uphill. </p>
<p>
     Lifts are closed at Aspen&apos;s four ski resorts, but Aspen Skiing is one of the few companies still allowing locals to skin uphill -- also known as alpine touring -- at their own risk and safe distance. Mr. Sachson had been avoiding skiing in the backcountry, which poses higher avalanche danger, instead taking advantage of groomed trails on Aspen&apos;s mountains. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Patterson was already an uphill enthusiast. Mr. Sachson dusted off old gear and bought his nephew a splitboard -- a snowboard that could be split lengthwise, each half worn like a ski to ascend the mountain, and reattached to ride down. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Patterson&apos;s three cousins, ages 15, 17 and 28, are staying with their grandparents in Aspen until things calm down. They joined the uphill crew, and were skinning almost daily, working to keep 6 feet apart -- about the length of skis -- and maintaining extra caution due to the absence of ski patrol and overstressed hospitals. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, Snowsports Industries America launched a social media campaign called #CurbYourTurns urging skiers to stay off mountains for now. Mr. Sachson says he and his family plan to transition to long walks on safe trails to avoid being part of the problem. &quot;Legally, uphill is allowed, but ethically we&apos;re feeling it&apos;s not what we should be doing right now,&quot; he says. &quot;There are other ways to get fresh air that pose less risks.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sachson normally gains 5 pounds each winter. Shorter daylight hours and 13-hour work days leave him little opportunity to enjoy the outdoors. As people are urged to stay home and practice social distancing to slow the spread of coronavirus, visitations and adoptions have been temporarily suspended at the shelter. </p>
<p>
     He is still working seven days a week to care for the remaining dogs and cats, but he says the crisis has provided a wake-up call to what&apos;s important in life: family and health. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I enjoy getting outside with our 9 1/2 -month-old daughter and have always encouraged Seth to make time to exercise with me,&quot; Ms. Patterson says. &quot;Now that he is not crazy busy at work, we are actually enjoying quality time together.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Workout </p>
<p>
     Aspen sits almost 8,000 feet above sea level. The group started skinning on what Mr. Sachson says is the area&apos;s easiest mountain, Buttermilk, to give out-of-towners a chance to acclimate to the altitude. Some of their first routes tackled around 1,500 feet of elevation gain. &quot;It was really hard,&quot; Mr. Trattler says. &quot;You aren&apos;t going fast, but the effort is like sprinting up a mountain. You definitely sweat.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Ms. Patterson gets an extra workout by carrying her daughter, Henri Rose, in a backpack. Mr. Sachson owns nine dogs and tries to bring around five at a time on their treks, which average two to three hours. </p>
<p>
     The family had been gradually climbing higher, ascending Elk Camp, a route on Snowmass mountain with 2,878 feet of elevation gain. In light of concern over injury in a time of limited health care, they have recently restricted outings to shorter ascents and descents on Buttermilk Mountain. Now they are hiking local trails and walking at a local golf course. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sachson is a distance runner and says if it hadn&apos;t been for a lull in work, he wouldn&apos;t have learned to love skiing uphill. &quot;It kicks your butt,&quot; he says. &quot;Running 13 miles comes naturally to me. My body enjoys that pain.&quot; He&apos;s always preferred summer sports, but says now that he&apos;s found he can hit his runner&apos;s high skinning, he&apos;s looking forward to next winter season. </p>
<p>
     The Diet </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sachson gathers eggs from his chickens each morning and makes scrambled eggs on toasted English muffins for breakfast. Vegan protein bars and dried mango provide sustenance while skinning. Mr. Sachson says rehydrating regularly is important while exercising at altitude. Family lunch is tomato soup with French bread. Sea bass with butternut squash, broccolini and asparagus is typical for dinner. </p>
<p>
     The Gear and Cost </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sachson wears lightweight North Face snow pants and a T-shirt and Obermeyer down snowshirt ($160). If he hikes up the mountain, he wears Scarpa running shoes with Stabilicers winter traction cleats ($50). </p>

Government Tracking How People Move Around in Coronavirus Pandemic</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Byron Tau </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- Government officials across the U.S. are using location data from millions of cellphones in a bid to better understand the movements of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic and how they may be affecting the spread of the disease. </p>
<p>
     The federal government, through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state and local governments have started to receive analyses about the presence and movement of people in certain areas of geographic interest drawn from cellphone data, people familiar with the matter said. The data comes from the mobile advertising industry rather than cellphone carriers. </p>
<p>
     The aim is to create a portal for federal, state and local officials that contains geolocation data in what could be as many as 500 cities across the U.S., one of the people said, to help plan the epidemic response. </p>
<p>
     The data -- which is stripped of identifying information like the name of a phone&apos;s owner -- could help officials learn how coronavirus is spreading around the country and help blunt its advance. It shows which retail establishments, parks and other public spaces are still drawing crowds that could risk accelerating the transmission of the virus, according to people familiar with the matter. In one such case, researchers found that New Yorkers were congregating in large numbers in Brooklyn&apos;s Prospect Park and handed that information over to local authorities, one person said. Warning notices have been posted at parks in New York City, but they haven&apos;t been closed. </p>
<p>
     The data can also reveal general levels of compliance with stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, according to experts inside and outside government, and help measure the pandemic&apos;s economic impact by revealing the drop-off in retail customers at stores, decreases in automobile miles driven and other economic metrics. </p>
<p>
     The CDC has started to get data through one project, dubbed the Covid-19 Mobility Data Network, that is being coordinated through an ad hoc coalition of epidemiologists at Harvard, Princeton, Johns Hopkins and other universities along with numerous tech companies and data providers -- all working primarily with state and local governments, the people said. </p>
<p>
     The CDC and the White House didn&apos;t respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>
     The growing reliance on mobile phone location data continues to raise concerns about privacy protections, especially when programs are run by or commissioned by governments. </p>
<p>
     Wolfie Christl, a privacy activist and researcher, said the location-data industry was &quot;covidwashing&quot; what are generally privacy-invading products. </p>
<p>
     &quot;In the light of the emerging disaster, it may be appropriate to make use of aggregate analytics based on consumer data in some cases, even if data is being gathered secretly or illegally by companies,&quot; said Mr. Christl. &quot;As true anonymization of location data is nearly impossible, strong legal safeguards are mandatory.&quot; The safeguards should limit how the data can be used and ensure it isn&apos;t used later for other purposes, he said. </p>
<p>
     Privacy advocates are concerned that even anonymized data could be used in combination with other publicly accessible information to identify and track individuals. </p>
<p>
     Some companies in the U.S. location-data industry have made their data or analysis available for the public to see or made their raw data available for researchers or governments. San Francisco-based LotaData launched a public portal analyzing movement patterns within Italy that could help authorities plan for outbreaks and plans additional portals for Spain, California and New York. The company Unacast launched a public &quot;social distancing scoreboard&quot; that uses location data to evaluate localities on how well their population is doing at following stay-at-home orders. </p>
<p>
     Other state and local governments too have begun to commission their own studies and analyses from private companies. Foursquare Labs Inc., one of the largest location-data players, said it is in discussions with numerous state and local governments about use of its data. </p>
<p>
     Researchers and governments around the world have used a patchwork of authorities and tactics to collect mobile phone data -- sometimes looking for voluntary compliance from either companies or individuals, and in other cases using laws meant for terrorism or other emergencies to collect vast amounts of data on citizens to combat the coronavirus threat. </p>
<p>
     Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers have launched a project to track volunteer Covid-19 patients through a mobile phone app. Telecom carriers in Germany, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the U.K. and other countries have given data over to authorities to help combat the pandemic. Israel&apos;s intelligence agencies were tapped to use antiterrorism phone-tracking technology to map infections. </p>
<p>
     In the U.S., so far, the data being used has largely been drawn from the advertising industry. The mobile marketing industry has billions of geographic data points on hundreds of millions of U.S. cell mobile devices -- mostly drawn from applications that users have installed on their phones and allowed to track their location. Huge troves of this advertising data are available for sale. </p>
<p>
     The industry is largely unregulated under existing privacy laws because consumers have opted-in to tracking and because the data doesn&apos;t contain names or addresses -- each consumer is represented by an alphanumeric string. </p>
<p>
     Cellphone carriers also have access to massive amounts of geolocation data, which is granted much stricter privacy protection under U.S. law than in most other countries. The largest U.S. carriers, including  AT&amp;T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., say they have not been approached by the government to provide location data, according to spokespeople. There have been discussions about trying to obtain U.S. telecom data for this purpose, however the legality of such a move isn&apos;t clear. </p>

  Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p>
   This article was corrected March 29, 2020 to reflect that the Covid-19 Mobility Data Network is working primarily with state and local governments. The original version of this article incorrectly said it was providing location data insights to the federal government in the 6th paragraph. In addition, the last name of researcher Wolfie Christl was misspelled as Christi in one instance. </p>

Kroger Stock Is Weathering the Coronavirus Outbreak. Insiders Have Stepped Up Stock Sales. -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Ed Lin </pre>
<p>
     Kroger stock has largely dodged the market disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak, and insiders have stepped up sales of their shares of the biggest U.S. supermarket chain. Shares have edged up 0.5% so far this year compared with the 21.3% dive in the S&amp;P 500 index, a measure of the broader market. </p>
<p>
     Kroger (ticker: KR) executives and directors have sold $4.7 million of stock since the beginning of the year compared with $2.2 million in all of last year. Some are selling for the first time in years. Groceries and other food retailers are seeing their most robust business in years as shoppers stock up for extended lockdowns. Kroger has said it wants to hire 10,000 workers to meet demand. </p>
<p>
     The company declined to comment on the stock sales. </p>
<p>
     Robert W. Clark, senior vice president of supply chain, manufacturing, and sourcing, has been the biggest seller of Kroger stock this year. Clark sold 48,500 shares in March for $1.6 million, a per-share average of $32.09. He now owns 185,518 shares, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He last sold stock in December 2018 when he sold 14,500 shares for $233,300, a per-share average price of $29.16. </p>
<p>
     James A. Runde, who has been a Kroger director since 2006, has sold 35,000 shares for $1.1 million, an average price of $32.80 each. Runde, a former vice chairman of Morgan Stanley (MS), now owns 102,578 Kroger shares. Last year, he sold 9,030 Kroger shares for $194,360, an average price per share of $21.52. </p>
<p>
     Chief Operating Officer Michael J. Donnelly has sold 17,514 Kroger shares for $513,700, a per-share average price of $29.33. Donnelly sold stock through planned transactions using a so-called Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that he adopted on Sept. 23, 2019. Such a device automatically executes transactions when conditions set by the insider, such as price and volume, are met. Planned transactions are meant to remove any potential bias an insider may have from knowledge of material nonpublic information. Donnelly sold 56,890 shares in 2019, some through planned transactions, for a total of $1.5 million. </p>
<p>
     Erin S. Sharp, group vice president of manufacturing, has sold 11,829 Kroger shares for $390,400, a per-share average of $33. Her last open-market transaction was in September 2018 when Sharp sold 25,314 Kroger shares for $734,106. </p>
<p>
     Bobby S. Shackouls, a Kroger director, and Mark C. Tuffin, a senior vice president, have sold shares valued at $263,300 and $74,000, respectively. Both last sold Kroger stock in 2015. </p>

Due to their insider status, these investors are required to disclose stock trades with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory groups. </p>

Under Armour Stock Sinks as Sports Remain Halted. Why It&apos;s Not a Buy at the Cheaper Price. -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Connor Smith </pre>
<p>
     The sporting world&apos;s virtual halt was the last thing Under Armour stock needed amid the company&apos;s turnaround. </p>
<p>
     The athleticwear company&apos;s shares (ticker: UAA) have shed more than half their value in 2020. But it isn&apos;t the right time to buy, according to Stifel analyst Jim Duffy. He lowered his rating to Hold from Buy, along with his price target to $11 from $16. </p>
<p>
     &quot;While no less bullish on strategic direction under new leadership and longterm margin prospects, the growing list of near-term risks puts our optimism for shares on the bench for the remainder of 2020,&quot; he wrote. </p>
<p>
     Major League Baseball&apos;s opening day was postponed. March Madness cancelled. The National Basketball Association season suspended. Even the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics won&apos;t happen until 2021. With the major sports postponed indefinitely, Under Armour&apos;s marketing with professional athletes will have to go on hold. The NCAA tournament means its sponsored teams won&apos;t show off their fresh gear until next season. </p>
<p>
     The same goes for the company&apos;s sponsored baseball superstars Bryce Harper and Christian Yelich, who could be facing a shortened -- or even cancelled -- 2020 season, depending on how the coronavirus threat progresses. And youth sports are also cancelled, meaning lower demand for such products. </p>
<p>
     He also thinks such disruption in the spring selling season will lead to excess inventory that could pressure margins. &quot;As we saw in 2016, risks go beyond Under Armour inventory concerns,&quot; he wrote. &quot;When larger players like NIKE have excess, liquidation efforts can crowd smaller players out of the marketplace and undermine liquidation efforts at outlet centers.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;These challenges are all palpable concerns which don&apos;t account for demand uncertainties in 2H and into 2021 that challenge inventory planning and cash flow management into summer, back-to-school and Holiday,&quot; he added. </p>
<p>
     Duffy notes Under Armour has more than $500 million in cash on hand and $1.5 billion in additional borrowing capacity. He thinks the company can navigate these challenges, but such disruptions will be a setback. </p>
<p>
     Under Armour stock was down 4.6% to $9.44 on Friday, down about 56% in 2020. </p>

Global Economic Fallout Grows as Coronavirus Cases Pass 600,000 -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Stella Yifan Xie </pre>
<p>
     Concerns about the financial toll of the coronavirus pandemic continued to grow as the number of infections globally topped 600,000 Saturday, with the International Monetary Fund warning of an economic and financial crisis exceeding that of a decade ago. </p>
<p>
     Overlapping travel bans and lockdowns have hammered businesses and led to millions of job losses, punctuated by a spike in U.S. unemployment claims to more than three million this week and a warning of a deep recession this year in trade bellwether Singapore. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009,&quot; Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, said Friday. Rising bankruptcies and layoffs could undermine any recovery and do long-lasting damage to the world economy, she said. </p>
<p>
     The risks have added urgency for countries around the world to extend relief packages to ease financial distress. </p>
<p>
     U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed a $2 trillion stimulus plan, the largest economic relief package in history. </p>
<p>
     With the pneumonia-causing virus spreading across the U.S. and Europe, after it was first detected in central China three months ago, governments around the world have ramped up efforts to limit people&apos;s movement and began imposing wide-ranging closures on businesses, restaurants and schools domestically in recent weeks. </p>
<p>
     Increasingly strict travel bans set up by large countries including the U.S. and China have put a dent in global commerce, complicating efforts to reignite growth. </p>
<p>
     France and Belgium on Friday extended their national lockdowns by two weeks, until mid-April. French Prime Minister &#201;douard Philippe said experts advising the government recommended the lockdown remain for at least six weeks. Russia on Friday suspended all passenger flights to and from the country. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York and increased testing. The growth outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second and third most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000 respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>
<p>
     The IMF warned that low-income countries will be hit particularly hard given a combination of a health crisis, sudden reversal of capital flows and in some cases a plunge in commodity prices. In Russia, where oil exports account for roughly one-third of government revenue, the ruble has fallen to its lowest level in four years. The IMF estimated that at least $2.5 trillion is needed to contain economic contraction for emerging markets. </p>
<p>
     The Chinese government is also wrestling with the economic blow from the SARS-like virus, first from a prolonged halt in domestic business activities and now from weaker consumer sentiment and shrinking export demand as the coronavirus engulfs Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, the country&apos;s top decision-making body said the government plans to boost spending by increasing its fiscal deficit this year, as well as speed up issuance of Treasury bonds and so-called local government special-purpose bonds to support funding of infrastructure projects, as part of the stimulus measures to curtail economic impact from the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The fiscal policy needs to be more proactive, and the prudent monetary policy needs to be more flexible,&quot; said a statement from Friday&apos;s meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, chaired by President Xi Jinping. The government also called for a gradual reopening of shopping malls and markets to boost consumer spending. </p>
<p>
     Lu Ting, an economist with Nomura, estimated that, over the second and possibly third quarters, China&apos;s exports could contract by a total of 30% from a year earlier, wiping out 18 million jobs, or about a third of those tied to trade. To counter the negative impact from the outbreak, Beijing is likely to cut its benchmark deposit rate as well as raise the fiscal deficit target to 3.5% of GDP, up from 2.8% in 2019, he wrote in a research note on Saturday. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 54 new infections Friday, saying all were imported from abroad, bringing the total to 81,394. </p>
<p>
     Other countries continue to tighten rules on social distancing. Iran this week closed shopping centers and banned road travel between cities, pledging to fine and impound the cars of offenders. Iranian officials have warned the population to brace for a second wave of infections. Afghanistan on Friday expanded restrictions by announcing a three-week lockdown on its capital, Kabul. Lebanon, which extended its nationwide lockdown until April 12, on Friday imposed a nighttime curfew. </p>
<p>
     In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan introduced further travel restrictions this weekend to combat the spread of the virus, which has infected 5,698 people and killed 92 in the country, according to a tally by national health authorities. Intercity bus and air traffic will be reduced to a minimum while all international flights will be suspended. </p>
<p>
     Hong Kong banned public gatherings of four or more people beginning midnight Sunday, with those violating the rules facing fines of more than $3,000 and six months in jail. Singapore said it would fine people who violate its social distancing rules up to about $7,000. </p>
<p>
     Australia said it would quarantine citizens returning from overseas in hotels for 14 days beginning midnight Saturday. </p>

Who&apos;s Left Out of Coronavirus Stimulus Payments? Many College Students, Adult Dependents</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Richard Rubin </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- The government is preparing to send one-time payments to most Americans to help them cope with the coronavirus outbreak, but that is little comfort for many college students and adult dependents who are left out. </p>
<p>
     The economic-relief law signed by President Trump on Friday provides $1,200 to most adults and $500 for children under age 17. That money -- $292 billion -- will start flowing within weeks from the Internal Revenue Service into bank accounts. People with little or no income can qualify, which means money will flow to retired people and people who don&apos;t normally file tax returns. The benefit phases out for individuals with income above $75,000 and married couples with income above $150,000. </p>
<p>
     However, the plan excludes anyone who isn&apos;t a child and who can be claimed as someone else&apos;s dependent. Who is in that group? Some high-school students, college students and some disabled and elderly people, many of whom show up on the tax returns of the people they live with who provide most of their support. </p>
<p>
     They won&apos;t get money directly, and no one will get money for them. In all, that is about 21 million Americans, according to the Tax Policy Center. Immigrants who don&apos;t have Social Security numbers also aren&apos;t eligible. </p>
<p>
     &quot;That [$500] could be a month&apos;s worth of food,&quot; said Fern Maklin, 71 years old, who is a dependent of her daughter and son-in-law in Palm Harbor, Fla., and contributes her Social Security payments to the household. &quot;The stress and the anxiety, we try to keep it low key, but it&apos;s there.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Parents and adults who have those dependents will still be able to claim the $1,200 for themselves. They just won&apos;t get an additional $500 for each of those dependents. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Dependents, by definition, aren&apos;t responsible for a majority of their financial support,&quot; said Michael Zona, a spokesman for the Senate Finance Committee, which wrote the legislation. &quot;The goal of the recovery rebates is to provide support for Americans who are responsible for their own financial well-being or that of another during this pandemic.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The definition of who gets $500 is similar to the one that is used for annual tax credits to create a distinction between children under 17 and others. </p>
<p>
     Lawmakers based this week&apos;s bill on similar payments made in 2008, which also excluded the same group of non-child dependents. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Legislation is never perfect and always involves trade-offs,&quot; Mr. Zona said. &quot;That is especially true of emergency legislation in the midst of a crisis. Using existing mechanisms already in place saves time when every moment matters.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Congress is already starting to work on the next round of its response to the virus outbreak, and some advocates are pushing for broader payments. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Behind a welcome bipartisan push, the stimulus rebates are broad and rightly include very poor families,&quot; said Chuck Marr, senior director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who said non-child dependents and immigrants without social security numbers should be added. &quot;Many of them are on the front lines, delivering food and caring for the elderly.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Travis Miller, a teacher in Nashua, Iowa, said he couldn&apos;t understand why he would get a payment for his 16-year-old son but not for his 18-year-old daughter. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It doesn&apos;t make or break our household as far as money goes,&quot; he said. &quot;To me, it&apos;s more of a principle thing. If we are going to give money out to people in general, why are we not giving it out to all people?&quot; </p>
<p>
     The IRS hasn&apos;t yet provided details about how it will administer the new provision. The IRS will be basing payments on 2019 tax returns or on 2018 tax returns if 2019 isn&apos;t filed yet. </p>
<p>
     It isn&apos;t clear what will happen, for example, if someone was 16 years old on the 2018 return but has since turned 17 and become ineligible for the $500 credit. If the IRS treats that person as 16, some families will have an incentive to wait to file their 2019 tax returns with a 17-year-old until after they get the payments. The payments do not have to be paid back later. </p>
<p>
     The law also gives people who have been claimed as dependents in the past an incentive to file their own separate tax returns to get $1,200 if they are in fact independent. But the restriction on payments applies to anyone who can be claimed as a dependent, which could let the IRS enforce that restriction by examining how much support a particular person receives from others. </p>
<p>
     Jeff Cunningham, an internal auditor in Pittsburgh, has three children between ages 18 and 22, all of whom are in school and work part-time. He had hoped they could benefit, but they won&apos;t. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We can live with half or nothing,&quot; Mr. Cunningham said. &quot;I think that they should get the 1,200 bucks. They could certainly use it.&quot; </p>

Small Businesses Struggle With SBA Disaster Loan Applications</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Yuka Hayashi in Washington and Ruth Simon in New York </pre>
<p>
     The Small Business Administration&apos;s disaster loan program for small businesses has gotten off to a rocky start, with businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic complaining about an inability to file their loan applications online. </p>
<p>
     Small-business owners and advocates, including Jen Earle, chief executive of the National Association of Women Business Owners, said loan seekers either couldn&apos;t gain access to the online application site or were bounced off before they could complete their application. </p>
<p>
     In response to the complaints, the agency adopted a new system where loan seekers download application forms and fill them out manually before uploading them onto the agency&apos;s site, according to business owners who are seeking loans. That change meant that business owners who had started the process but not completed it had to re-enter their information a second time. </p>
<p>
     The disaster loan assistance, provided through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, is among the first steps the SBA took to help small businesses hit by the virus outbreak. The program is separate from the $349 billion in loan guarantees included in the coronavirus stimulus plan passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on Friday. The program allows the SBA to lend up to $2 million directly to each qualified applicant as working capital under a measure signed on March 6. The program has received $7 billion in available funds. </p>
<p>
     Tom Lussenhop, president of U3 Ventures, a real-estate developer in Philadelphia with three employees, said he spent nearly eight hours typing in information onto the agency&apos;s online portal between a week ago Thursday and Saturday, only to see the site crash on Sunday before he completed his application. </p>
<p>
     Since the website relaunched with a new format on Wednesday, he has been working to fill out a downloaded application form, worrying that he might be counted twice because of the earlier online account. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s frustrating,&quot; said Mr. Lussenhop, who expects his firm&apos;s revenue to fall 40% in April. That&apos;s when some of his tenants, including a restaurant, are expected to stop paying rent. &quot;It&apos;s not a $10 million loan. It&apos;s a $50,000 loan.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Aaron VanderGalien, senior partner with Deksia, a Grand Rapids, Mich., marketing agency that has 18 employees and has seen revenue fall by more than one-third, said the loan application itself was confusing. </p>
<p>
     Because the loan application is designed for natural disasters, not economic ones, it asks borrowers to estimate how much they have lost for categories such as real estate, inventory and equipment. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I have no idea how much money I applied for,&quot; said Mr. VanderGalien, who completed his application March 20. &quot;There is nowhere to put any amount in.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Tony Wright, the owner of WrightIMC, a digital marketing agency in Dallas with 15 employees, called the SBA&apos;s helpline after he was locked out of the system on Tuesday. </p>
<p>
     He was told he was number 757 in the queue; the wait was about 2 hours and 45 minutes, he said. </p>
<p>
     Once he was reinstated, Mr. Wright said he spent seven hours working on his application before he finally gave up for the day. He spent Thursday re-entering the forms and then submitting the PDF, after the SBA had changed its process. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I only received a confirmation on the website that the forms were submitted,&quot; not an email or other notification, said Mr. Wright, who figures business is off close to 50%. &quot;I hope they are not lost in the ether.&quot; </p>

Small Business Administration&apos;s New Boss Has Big Job Ahead</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Yuka Hayashi </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- Jovita Carranza, the newly appointed head of the Small Business Administration, just found herself leading the charge in one front in the epic battle against the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     With the pandemic threatening to engulf many of the country&apos;s 30 million small businesses, the 70-year-old Ms. Carranza is now the Trump administration&apos;s point person on shoring up a sector of the economy that accounts for 44% of gross domestic product, by the agency&apos;s estimates. </p>
<p>
     Her agency faces the enormous responsibility of ensuring small businesses get $349 billion in SBA-guaranteed loans, a crucial chunk of the estimated $2 trillion government rescue package. </p>
<p>
     The challenge: The SBA has never done anything even remotely comparable to the urgent task on its agenda, and Ms. Carranza has only been on the job for three months. </p>
<p>
     The SBA, a small federal agency with 4,000 employees, has already struggled to disburse funds in a timely manner when faced with recent natural disasters, including the 2017 hurricane damage in Puerto Rico. Some small-business owners already say they are having difficulty accessing SBA&apos;s website to apply for assistance since last week. </p>
<p>
     The amount Congress set aside to guarantee small-business loans by banks, credit unions and other lenders is 12 times the size of the loans the agency approved last year. </p>
<p>
     And timely dispersal will be crucial, as many small businesses are running out of money and fighting for survival. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Her urgent task is to ensure these small-business owners get cash immediately, as quickly as possible, to give them relief, and to make sure they are giving relief to their employees,&quot; said Renee Johnson, senior government affairs manager at Main Street Alliance, a small business advocacy group. </p>
<p>
     The highest-ranking woman of Latin American heritage in the Trump administration, Ms. Carranza has served as President Trump&apos;s ambassador to the Hispanic community, where his support is spotty. </p>
<p>
     She declined to be interviewed, but when confirmed by the Senate in January, she described herself as the &quot;embodiment of that American dream, &quot; a child of Mexican immigrants who raced up the corporate ladder to reach the pinnacle of the federal government. </p>
<p>
     People who know Ms. Carranza say she is as qualified for the challenge as anyone might be. She served as the SBA&apos;s No. 2 official between 2006 and 2009, after a successful career in the private sector. She also has unusually strong bipartisan support from lawmakers, with whom she now needs to work even more closely than before. </p>
<p>
     &quot;She is very practical,&quot; said Shane Jett, chief executive of Citizen Potawatomi Community Development Corp., in Shawnee, Okla., which focuses on making loans to Native American entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Jett served with Ms. Carranza on a Treasury Department panel that advises on loans to lower-income communities. &quot;What motivates her is trying to figure out how to shape policy where it impacts the most,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     In the Trump administration, Ms. Carranza initially served as U.S. Treasurer under Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin -- a job that meant her signature appeared on dollar bills alongside that of Mr. Mnuchin. </p>
<p>
     She also advised Mr. Mnuchin on the &quot;Opportunity Zones&quot; program, Mr. Trump&apos;s initiative to encourage business investments in economically distressed communities. </p>
<p>
     Before coming to Washington, Ms. Carranza spent more than 30 years at United Parcel Service, where she started in California working part-time loading trucks while raising a child as a single mother. </p>
<p>
     She eventually rose to the position of vice president of Air Operations and president of Operations for Latin American and the Caribbean, overseeing thousands of employees. Her responsibilities in those roles ranged from acquiring airport landing rights, negotiating with unions and upgrading automation systems. </p>
<p>
     &quot;She had a great history within UPS,&quot; said Ron Wallace, former president of UPS International who promoted Ms. Carranza to Latin America chief in 2000. &quot;She was a good partner, and she had all the characteristics to lead when necessary.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Senate confirmed her as SBA administrator in January on an 88-to-5 vote, an overwhelming margin rare in the current divisive political environment. Ms. Carranza, who grew up in Chicago, is a longtime GOP supporter who campaigned for Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If years ago someone had told six-year-old Jovita, while she was sitting at the kitchen table being taught the value of a hard-earned dollar, that someday her name would be printed on every U.S. dollar, she would never have believed it,&quot; Ms. Carranza told senators at her December confirmation hearing. &quot;But I sit here before you today, the embodiment of that American dream.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Small Business Committee, said during the January confirmation vote that he was &quot;optimistic that Treasurer Carranza can be the leader and advocate that SBA and American small businesses need right now.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Before the virus outbreak started shutting down many businesses this month, Ms. Carranza told lawmakers that beefing up the agency&apos;s disaster relief program would be a priority. </p>
<p>
     During her previous SBA tenure, she established a disaster recovery plan following Hurricane Katrina, which became the foundation for the agency&apos;s current disaster response structure, she said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I can assure the members of the committee that when a disaster event affects your district or state, SBA will be there in time of need,&quot; she told House lawmakers during a Feb. 26 hearing. A week later, the agency started offering disaster assistance loans for small businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak. </p>
<p>
     Lawmakers from both parties have since praised the agency&apos;s swift approval of states&apos; applications to make the loans available for their local businesses. Business owners, however, have complained about the difficulty reaching the SBA with emails and phone calls, as well as through its website. </p>

Coronavirus Silences the Concert Industry</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Anne Steele </pre>
<p>
     The concert industry was supposed to have its best year ever, highlighted by tours including the Rolling Stones, Elton John and Post Malone. Now, it&apos;s hard to say when the next show will take place. </p>
<p>
     After a yearslong explosion in live events -- propelled by musicians&apos; reliance on touring income and fans&apos; willingness to pay top dollar -- the global live-music business was on track to generate $28.8 billion in revenue in 2020, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC. </p>
<p>
     But because of the novel coronavirus, the industry now faces a decimated summer concert season followed by the monumental challenge of rescheduling thousands of shows, putting it in line for its toughest year since the 2008 financial crisis. The list of postponements grows by the day: Pearl Jam, Billie Eilish, Zac Brown Band, Celine Dion. </p>
<p>
     Live Nation Entertainment Inc., the biggest player in the industry, could have the most to lose. As of Dec. 31, the company said it had cash and cash equivalents worth $2.5 billion, enough to keep the lights on for several months, even amid widespread postponements or cancellations, people familiar with the matter say. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are fortunate to have the resources to make it through this intermission period, even if it goes longer than expected,&quot; Live Nation President Joe Berchtold said. &quot;Ultimately we&apos;re able to adapt and are moving most shows, not losing them.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Spring is a quiet time in the live-music business, so it wasn&apos;t catastrophic when Live Nation and its next-largest rival, closely held Anschutz Entertainment Group, suspended shows through the end of March. Analysts hoped it would be a blip from which Live Nation could recover come the critical summer season. </p>
<p>
     But the outlook dimmed as state and local authorities started banning large events and issuing shelter-in-place orders. The uncertainty over how long such policies will last calls into question whether a ramp-up in touring will even be feasible this year. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The challenge for us is to make sure we take advantage of pent-up demand,&quot; said Tim Leiweke, chief executive of entertainment and sport-facilities firm Oak View Group. </p>
<p>
     Oak View&apos;s network of nearly 30 arenas is focused on rescheduling tours in the second half of this year and into 2021. Many dates are on hold, Mr. Leiweke said, but won&apos;t be announced until &quot;we&apos;re confident we&apos;re through the curve and on the way back.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Live Nation typically generates most of its revenue between April and October, particularly from its 59 outdoor amphitheaters, the company&apos;s most profitable venues. </p>
<p>
     While concerts at indoor venues like arenas or theaters can be rescheduled any time of year, amphitheater shows and festivals are seasonally dependent. Meanwhile, the stadium shows executives planned on making 2020 blockbuster may no longer be possible this year. </p>
<p>
     The Rolling Stones postponed their AEG-promoted stadium tour, originally slated to run from May to July, without setting new dates. </p>
<p>
     Executives at Live Nation have remained upbeat about being able to reschedule shows for the second half of the year. A person close to the company said it is prioritizing fitting the biggest summer tours into the last three months of this year, and filling others into the beginning of next year. </p>
<p>
     Many in the industry remain skeptical about how well mass-rescheduling will work, considering venue availability and consumer demand. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If all the tours that were going out this summer tried to move to the fall all these acts would be cannibalizing themselves and venues,&quot; said promotion veteran Randy Phillips, adding re-bookings would be further complicated by the return of the NBA and NHL, whose now-sidelined teams play in the same arenas as major pop acts. </p>
<p>
     Even in cases where new dates are set, concert promoters might offer fans the choice of refund, a costly process where fees to the promoter and ticketing company are lost after twice the work. </p>
<p>
     Investors worry that Live Nation could break a debt-to-earnings ratio covenant on loans worth up to $1.85 billion if it is unable to stage events in the second quarter. The company is in talks with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to amend the credit agreement, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>
     When it comes to cash to fund ongoing operations, LightShed Partners analyst Brandon Ross said the company could make it through September with next to no events, and could tap its estimated $2 billion deferred revenue balance, money it collects and holds from its own venues. But if event cancellations stretch through the end of 2020, Live Nation may need to take on more debt or raise equity. </p>
<p>
     Still, he said, &quot;even in worst-case 2020 scenarios, we see [Live Nation] rebounding post-coronavirus to a stronger position than ever.&quot; </p>
<p>
     For AEG, controlled by billionaire Philip Anschutz, maintaining its network of seven arenas around the world, including the Staples Center in Los Angeles and the O2 in London, through months without events could be especially costly. </p>
<p>
     Another cloud is that an economic recession will leave regular concertgoers short on cash well after quarantines are lifted. And there is the question of how long it may take for fans to be comfortable joining large crowds again. </p>
<p>
     Consumers, when asked which types of leisure-and-entertainment spending they expected to cut back on most in the event of recession, have widely cited live music -- yet cited it less frequently than going out to bars and eating out. Two-thirds of concertgoers said they aren&apos;t planning to stop going to gigs, according to a Midia Research study conducted at the end of 2019. </p>
<p>
     The broader effects of an anticipated stunted year have been immediate for some areas of the live business. Paradigm Talent Agency, United Talent Agency and StubHub, among others, have implemented layoffs, furloughs or pay cuts. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There are two majors buyers in the world: Live Nation and AEG,&quot; Mr. Phillips said. &quot;If either are in free fall, it affects the entire industry.&quot; </p>

Wall Street Says Some Broker Duties Can&apos;t Be Done From Home</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Dave Michaels </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- The new coronavirus hasn&apos;t shut down financial markets, thanks to electronic trading. But some tasks on Wall Street, it turns out, aren&apos;t made for social distancing. </p>
<p>
     Brokers are seeking permission from regulators to suspend some tasks that were developed during the era of paper stock certificates. Wall Street&apos;s main trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, says these mundane back-office chores, such as sending signed forms to regulators in Washington, can&apos;t be done when states including New York are on lockdown and even workers deemed essential have been urged to stay away from the office. </p>
<p>
     Sifma&apos;s request draws on a pandemic-response exercise it performed in 2007 with representatives from the Treasury Department and other agencies. That scenario asked firms to test their contingency plans assuming a 49% work absenteeism rate, a 40% reduction in air and land travel, and episodes of rolling blackouts and local curfews. Most firms at the time didn&apos;t believe a pandemic would cause them to cease trading, despite the more widespread use of open-outcry exchange floors at the time. </p>
<p>
     &quot;All you have to do is change it to 2020, and it&apos;s the discussion we are having today,&quot; said Thomas Price, Sifma&apos;s managing director of technology, operations and business continuity. </p>
<p>
     That nightmare scenario is playing out now on Wall Street, where many employees are working from home or backup locations. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman disclosed to his employees Thursday that about 90% of them are working from home. CNBC earlier reported Mr. Gorman&apos;s memo. </p>
<p>
     Brokers&apos; back-office employees perform important roles that range from accounting to compliance and information technology -- tasks that lack the glamour of chaotic trading desks and deal-pitching by investment bankers. </p>
<p>
     In the &quot;box count,&quot; for example, brokerage-firm employees inspect stock certificates held in vaults once a quarter to make sure they match ownership recorded in electronic databases. Some stocks are still owned in paper form, often by investors who have held the shares for decades. </p>
<p>
     The box count, which is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is all but impossible to carry out when some states have banned gatherings of more than 10 people, Sifma wrote in a letter to the regulator Wednesday. </p>
<p>
     Brokers have also sought relief from a requirement to fingerprint job applicants to make sure they don&apos;t have criminal records, saying they would rather not have to touch an ink pad or electronic machine that someone else has handled. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Who wants to do that?&quot; Robert Colby, chief legal officer of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, asked on a recent conference call held for smaller broker-dealers. Finra, which supervises brokers on behalf of the SEC, was hopeful the SEC would approve temporarily suspending fingerprinting, Mr. Colby said on the call, adding that Finra&apos;s employees also have their prints taken. </p>
<p>
     Manual signatures are also a problem, according to Sifma. They are still required on financial reports that brokerage firms file with the SEC and on detailed background disclosures that all new hires fill out. And while some documents can be notarized with a stamp that banks and broker-dealers use, Sifma says, it is unclear whether the stamps should be used at home by employees. </p>
<p>
     The SEC hasn&apos;t acted on Sifma&apos;s requests, but the regulator has accommodated many other requests for relief that cited business disruptions caused by the coronavirus crisis. Most SEC employees have been working from home since March 10. </p>
<p>
     For example, the SEC approved temporary relief from rules that require brokers to disclose information about how they execute customers&apos; orders. </p>
<p>
     The regulator is also weighing a request to push back the deadline for brokers to report all customer orders and trades to a new database known as the consolidated audit trail, which when completed will give the SEC its first full view of all of the activity in stock and options markets. Some brokers say &quot;significant personnel disruptions&quot; make it impossible to finish computer-system changes needed to report all customer activity to the audit trail, according to a letter sent by the exchanges to the SEC. </p>

More States Charge Fees for Electric Vehicles</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Scott Calvert </pre>
<p>
     More states are imposing special registration fees on electric vehicles, sparking complaints that the levies undermine efforts to get consumers to embrace alternative-fuel cars. </p>
<p>
     Twenty-eight states charge from $50 to more than $200 a year for plug-in electric cars, and 14 states have annual fees for plug-in hybrids that also use gasoline, according to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. The fees are meant to make up for the fact that electric-vehicle owners don&apos;t buy gas and thus don&apos;t pay gas taxes that states rely on for road work. The fees are generally in addition to standard vehicle registration fees. </p>
<p>
     &quot;There was practically no fee in place just a few years ago, and we&apos;ve seen this massive growth,&quot; said Kristy Hartman, NCSL&apos;s energy program director. </p>
<p>
     In 2019, plug-in vehicles made up just 2% of U.S. sales, or about 330,000 cars and trucks out of about 17 million overall. But officials are preparing for a future when a far higher share of drivers won&apos;t be fueling up at the pump, Ms. Hartman said. </p>
<p>
     To promote electric-vehicle purchases, a majority of states offer hefty tax incentives and other perks. </p>
<p>
     Some states offer incentives and impose fees, which sends conflicting signals to consumers, said Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, which includes auto makers, suppliers and other industry players. Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and Nissan Motor Co. are members. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Often those fees are in effect penalizing efficiency and innovation,&quot; Ms. Cullen said. </p>
<p>
     A Consumer Reports analysis last year found 11 states charge electric-vehicle owners more than what a typical driver of a new gas-powered car pays in gas taxes. Among them is Georgia, which has the nation&apos;s highest fee at $213, according to NCSL. </p>
<p>
     Atlanta resident Christopher Matos-Rogers and his husband both drive Teslas. While Mr. Matos-Rogers, 35 years old, said the couple can afford the fees -- he works in real estate, his husband is a database architect -- he thinks $75 to $100 a year would be a fair amount. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s very punitive, and it&apos;s exorbitant compared to a similar gas car,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Hartman, who lives in Colorado, said when she bought an electric Nissan Leaf last year, she received a $7,500 federal tax credit, a $5,000 state tax credit and a $3,500 rebate from an electric utility. She also paid a $50 recurring state registration fee. </p>
<p>
     States with fees span the political spectrum and include California, which has by far the most electric vehicles and offers incentives including a rebate of up to $7,000. It began charging a $100 fee for purchases of 2020 model-year cars. </p>
<p>
     Jonathan Williams, chief economist for the American Legislative Exchange Council, which advocates for free markets, said the fees are appropriate. &quot;Let&apos;s make sure everybody who uses the roads pays something toward keeping them up,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Gas taxes are states&apos; largest revenue source for fixing and maintaining roads and bridges. The relative value of gas taxes has fallen due to factors like improved fuel efficiency and the federal government&apos;s shifting more infrastructure costs to states, according to a recent National Governors Association report. More than 30 states have raised their gas tax in the past six years, it said. The federal gas tax hasn&apos;t risen since 1993. </p>
<p>
     The report said an annual flat fee on electric vehicles can disproportionately affect low-income drivers and that &quot;exceptionally high&quot; fees risk slowing adoption of the technology. </p>
<p>
     Georgia began charging a $200 fee in 2015, the same year lawmakers eliminated a $5,000 state tax credit. The fee has generated about $20 million, compared with about $8 billion from the state&apos;s gas tax, according to the Georgia Department of Revenue. </p>
<p>
     The department referred questions about the policy to the 2015 bill&apos;s legislative sponsors, none of whom responded to requests for comment. </p>
<p>
     Washington state resident Larry Copley said he doesn&apos;t mind paying his state&apos;s $105 annual fee for his Chevy Bolt, which he bought in 2017 for $34,500 using the federal tax credit. He said he figures the fee is comparable to gas taxes he would pay if he had a gas-powered car. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It doesn&apos;t concern me so much,&quot; said Mr. Copley, 62, a product safety engineer. </p>
<p>
     In Oregon, electric-vehicle owners can opt out of the flat $110 annual fee and instead join a program and pay 1.8 cents a mile. Someone who drives 10,000 miles a year would pay $180 a year. </p>
<p>
     Only 70 of the state&apos;s roughly 16,000 electric vehicles are in the program, probably because most owners aren&apos;t aware of it, said Maureen Bock, manager of the state Department of Transportation&apos;s Office of Innovations. </p>
<p>
     Program participants can pay the mileage fee daily, whereas new electric-car buyers who aren&apos;t in the program must pay four years&apos; worth of fees up front, or $440. Ms. Bock said some people prefer paying small amounts over time rather than a large amount all at once. </p>

Old Laptop, Tablet or Phone? Here&apos;s How They Can Help You Right Now</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Joanna Stern </pre>
<p>
     Calling all Marie Kondo defiers! Yes, you, who fought the good fight and refused to part with that crusty, dusty 9,000-pound laptop in your basement that we both know sparks absolutely no joy. </p>
<p>
     Fellow gadget hoarders, now is our time. </p>
<p>
     In the past week, I&apos;ve turned a 10-year-old laptop into a speedy Chromebook, an 8-year old iPad into a video-chat machine and a 15-year-old TV into a second monitor. Who&apos;s laughing now, Marie? </p>
<p>
     The Great Stay-at-Home Experiment of 2020 has left tech retailers looking like the morning after Black Friday. (Sad Saturday?) Many electronics won&apos;t ship from Amazon until the end of April. And, sure, brand new plus-$800 Apple laptops and tablets -- which I&apos;m in the process of reviewing -- can be yours ASAP, but this crisis has many of us rethinking our splurgey behavior. </p>
<p>
     So instead, to improve that new home office/classroom/yoga studio, let&apos;s all try what the gadget makers would rather we didn&apos;t: Dig out old tech instead of assuming we always need to buy new stuff. </p>
<p>
     A few safety rules before we start: If the gadget is cracked or badly shattered, don&apos;t take any chances. Wait to get it repaired or recycle it. If a battery has bulged, same thing. If something can&apos;t be updated to the latest software, check with the manufacturer to make sure it at least gets security patches. (More on that below.) </p>
<p>
     So now, with Swiffer sheets in hand, let&apos;s resuscitate some old tech! </p>
<p>
     Old Laptops </p>
<p>
     You know that Chromebook your kid has? Google&apos;s Chrome OS is based on an open-source operating system called Chromium OS, and it works well on computers with less horsepower than a tricycle. </p>
<p>
     Google doesn&apos;t offer Chrome OS to install on older machines, but a company called Neverware offers CloudReady, a version of that Chromium operating system that runs a Chrome-like browser with all the Google web apps you&apos;d want. You just can&apos;t run Android apps, like on newer Chromebooks. (Like Google&apos;s Chrome browser and Chromebooks in general, the privacy issues of using the web while logged in with a Google account still apply.) </p>
<p>
     The great news: Once you&apos;ve installed CloudReady on an old Mac or Windows PC, the only thing you&apos;ll be missing is that new-laptop smell. (Fact: New laptops smell delicious.) The bad news: Installing the software takes some tech expertise and about an hour. Please, your 1,000-piece puzzle can wait. </p>
<p>
     The process requires a newer Windows computer, Mac or Chromebook, which you use to load the software onto an 8GB-or-larger USB drive. After you go through that process, clearly explained here, you install the software on the old laptop. (Neverware has a list of system requirements here.) On my 2009 Lenovo ThinkPad T400s, which miraculously still had working Wi-Fi, the Chrome browser sailed along smoothly. In fact, I wrote some of this column on the wonderful ThinkPad keyboard. They don&apos;t make keyboards like they used to. </p>
<p>
     Could I use it as my full-time machine? Heck no. But for writing or simple web work, sure. My biggest issue? The laptop&apos;s battery barely holds a charge anymore so I had to cuddle up to the wall outlet. </p>
<p>
     A tip from my Chromebook-loving colleague Christopher Mims: Don&apos;t do this to an old Chromebook. To try speeding that up, just reset it to factory settings and update it to the most recent OS version. </p>
<p>
     Old Tablets </p>
<p>
     My neighbor had left her 2012 iPad for dead in her attic. It&apos;s now alive and well -- in my living room. </p>
<p>
     She&apos;d said it was too slow to do anything and the battery was shot. The first issue I solved by restoring the iPad to factory settings. Save photos and anything else that&apos;s important, then go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Erase All Content and Settings. I also upgraded to the latest operating system supported on the device -- good old iOS 10, in this case. </p>
<p>
     There are downsides to being on an older system. Not only do you miss the latest features, you also might miss security updates. Apple releases patches for older devices if it feels they are critical. For example last year, it released a security patch for iOS 9 and 10 devices. Android is much trickier because there are so many different phone and tablet brands. This Android security site provides links to helpful resources. </p>
<p>
     As for my neighbor&apos;s battery problem? It was slow to charge but seemed OK after that. I also bought her a 10-foot Lightning cord, so she can keep it plugged into the wall. </p>
<p>
     There are loads of things to do with an old iPad but, as you&apos;ll see in the video above, I opted to make some homemade tablet stands and turn this into a portable video-chat machine that&apos;s always ready for FaceTime with the grandparents. Take that, Facebook Portal! I also installed Zoom, Google Hangouts and WhatsApp, for more video-chat options. (Speaking of video chatting, read my colleague Nicole Nguyen&apos;s recent piece for more tips and options.) </p>
<p>
     Other things to do with an old tablet: </p>
<p>
     --Turn it into a second monitor using Apple&apos;s own Sidecar tool or an app like Duet (though check the requirements). </p>
<p>
     --Turn it into a mini TV by downloading videos and streaming-video apps. </p>
<p>
     --Turn it into a kitchen helper with apps like AllRecipes, Epicurious and use Siri for setting a timer. </p>
<p>
     Old Smartphones </p>
<p>
     Many of my tablet tips apply to old phones, too. Considering, however, that the Apple TV remote is easier to lose than an AirPod in an airplane seat, I opted to take my old, cracked iPhone 6 and turn it into an extra controller. </p>
<p>
     I was able to use Apple&apos;s own Remote app for that, but there are loads of options depending on how you mix and match your devices. Roku and Amazon&apos;s Fire TV have Android and iOS apps that support wireless remote features. </p>
<p>
     One very important thing: Disable iMessage and your other Apple services on these old devices. Last thing you want is constantly dinging pop-up messages. </p>
<p>
     Other things you could do with an old smartphone: </p>
<p>
     --Turn it into a security camera with an app like Manything or AlfredCamera. </p>
<p>
     --Turn it into a kid&apos;s gaming and entertainment machine with some of these apps recommended by my colleague Julie Jargon -- complete with parental controls. </p>
<p>
     --Some other ideas: a smart-home remote control, a first camera for kids, an alarm clock/sleep tracker. </p>
<p>
     Old TVs </p>
<p>
     That old TV of yours might not have a 4K, HDR display, but it could still make a great second monitor for your new home office. You&apos;ll just need the right dongles. I needed an HDMI-to-USB-C dongle to hook my MacBook Pro up to an old 40-inch Toshiba TV I had in the closet. Given the fact that it basically magnifies everything on my Pro screen, I found it best to use it for watching videos. </p>
<p>
     I still haven&apos;t found any uses for my old Zune or BlackBerry, but luckily for me, just looking at them still sparks joy. And we could all use a little bit more of that right now. </p>

Update: BlackRock To Waive Fees For Running Federal Reserve Bond-buying Program -- MarketWatch</headline>
<text>
<p>
  BlackRock, the massive asset manager tapped to manage the Federal Reserve&apos;s bond purchase stimulus program, will charge no fee, according to a term sheet released late Friday. BlackRock (BLK) will also credit back the value of all underlying fees and income that it earns on its own exchange-traded funds within the program. &quot;Net fees for BlackRock, including the value of the credit, shall be made public on a regular basis,&quot; the term sheet said. The company also pledged to &quot;treat BlackRock-sponsored ETFs on the same neutral footing as third-party ETFs.&quot; The terms came after some criticism was directed at the Fed for giving the contract to a well-connected Wall Street firm. </p>

Residential REITs Will Weather the Coronavirus Crisis Better Than Malls. Here&apos;s Why. -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Lawrence C. Strauss </pre>
<p>
     Investors need to differentiate between real estate investor trust sectors because they&apos;ll be affected in various ways from the coronavirus pandemic, cautions research firm Green Street Advisors. </p>
<p>
     In a note Thursday, the firm said it was overweight most residential sectors, including apartments, and underweight shopping centers and mall sectors. That overweight excludes student housing. </p>
<p>
     While residential REITs won&apos;t be immune from the pandemic fallout, &quot;when the dust settles, the hit to net operating income and asset values will likely prove more benign than most property sectors,&quot; according to the report. </p>
<p>
     As of Wednesday&apos;s close, the FTSE NAREIT All REITs index was down about 19%, compared with an 11% decline for the S&amp;P 500. </p>
<p>
     Residential REITs are down about 24%, while regional malls were off nearly 50%. Shopping center REITs had lost about 35%. </p>
<p>
     An overhang for this part of the REIT market is the big financial difficulties retailers and other tenants are having. Cheesecake Factory (ticker: CAKE), for example, this week notified its landlords that it won&apos;t be able to pay its rent in April due to deteriorating business conditions. </p>
<p>
     Simon Property Group (SPG), a large mall and outlet operator, announced on March 18 that it was closing all of its retail properties through March 29. The stock has lost about half of its value this month. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Retail landlords are currently being barraged with a truly unprecedented number of demands for rent relief,&quot; according to Green Street. &quot;Many tenants are simply unable to pay their upcoming rent bill due to the forced closure of their business.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Many malls had been under pressure prior to the epidemic owing to the advent or online retailers and other factors. </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, residential REITs, Green Street notes, should get some protection from the federal government&apos;s $2 trillion stimulus package, which President Trump signed into law on Friday afternoon. &quot;Expanded unemployment benefits, in particular, will help mitigate some of the economic fallout for renters,&quot; it says. </p>
<p>
     A big player in the apartment REIT sector is Equity Residential (EQR), which is off 14% this month. The stock yields 3.8%. </p>
<p>
     It operates rental apartments primarily in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco, Southern California and Denver. </p>
<p>
     The steep recession brought on by the coronavirus fallout will not help apartment operators, as &quot;mounting job losses will undoubtedly pressure [net operating income] growth&quot; this year and in 2021. But the trajectory of that growth, the note adds, &quot;should stack up favorably versus many property types.&quot; </p>
<p>
     These operators, the report continues, will be helped by &quot;solid leasing achieved in recent quarters and &quot;strong occupancy and plummeting turnover over the coming months from shelter-in-place ordinances.&quot; </p>
<p>
     As the conronavirus fallout mounts, some REITs have already suspended or slashed their dividends. That includes Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, which said this week that it will cut its quarterly dividend to a penny a share from 38 cents. </p>
<p>
     However, a Jefferies research report was optimistic about dividend strength in the sector overall. </p>
<p>
     Dividend cuts among real-estate investment trusts were widespread during the Great Recession, according to the note. It pointed out that of the 68 public REITs in existence for more than 15 years, only 14 maintained dividends through the Great Recession. </p>
<p>
     But &quot;we expect most REITs can maintain yield, with their stronger dividend coverage, lower leverage and ample liquidity.&quot; </p>
<p>
     That assertion is likely to face a stiff test, particularly if the recession lingers. The companies the analysts like include Regency Centers (REG), whose &quot;Class A grocery-anchored shopping centers are defensive with consistent cash flow,&quot; Jefferies observes. </p>
<p>
     The stock, which yields about 6%, is down about 28% this month. </p>

  Esperion Announces Three Data Presentations of the NEXLETOL(TM) (bempedoic acid) Tablet and the NEXLIZET(TM) (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) Tablet at the American College of Cardiology&apos;s 69th Annual Scientific Session Together with World Congress of Cardiology (ACC.20/WCC) </p>
<p>
  ANN ARBOR, Mich., March 28, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Esperion (NASDAQ:ESPR) today announced that two pooled analyses from four Phase 3 clinical trials of NEXLETOL and results from the Phase 2 (1002-058) study of NEXLIZET were presented at the American College of Cardiology&apos;s 69(th) Scientific Session Together with World Congress of Cardiology (ACC.20/WCC). </p>
<p>
  A poster titled &quot;Bempedoic Acid 180 mg + Ezetimibe 10 mg Fixed Combination Drug Product vs Ezetimibe Alone or Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Hypercholesterolemia&quot; was presented by Harold E Bays, MD, FOMA, FTOS, FACC, FACE, FNLA. The poster highlighted that in the Phase 2 (1002-058) study, NEXLIZET significantly lowered LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C) by a mean 40% compared to placebo, reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) by 25% compared to baseline and resulted in no worsening of glycemic control. The incidence of adverse events rates were generally comparable to placebo. </p>
<p>
  In addition, a poster, titled &quot;Factors Influencing Bempedoic Acid--Mediated Reductions in High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein: Analysis of Pooled Patient-level Data from 4 Phase 3 Clinical Trials&quot; was presented by Eric S. G. Stroes, MD, PhD. The poster highlighted that in the pooled Phase 3 studies, NEXLETOL significantly lowered hsCRP in patients with hypercholesterolemia regardless of the presence or intensity of background statin therapy. In patients whose hsCRP levels were &gt;2 mg/L at baseline, the analysis showed NEXLETOL significantly reduced this marker of inflammation by 42% at 12 weeks. </p>
<p>
  The third poster, titled &quot;Bempedoic Acid Efficacy and Safety in Patients at High Risk for CVD Treated with or Without Ezetimibe: Pooled Analysis of 4 Phase 3 Clinical Trials&quot; was presented by Maciej Banach, MD, PhD, FAHA, FESC. The pooled analysis showed that in the Phase 3 studies, NEXLETOL provided significant additional LDL-C lowering as well as significantly lowered other lipid (total cholesterol, non-HDL-C Apo B, HDL-C) endpoints, regardless of the presence of background ezetimibe. Importantly, the safety profile of NEXLETOL was similar with or without background ezetimibe therapy. </p>
<p>
  &quot;We are pleased with the final results of the Phase 2 study that highlight NEXLIZET achieved an impressive 40 percent LDL-C lowering, a significant 25 percent reduction in hsCRP and did not worsen glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The additional pooled analyses from the Phase 3 LDL-C lowering development program demonstrate NEXLETOL can be safely added to multiple LDL-C medicines, which is important to help more patients reach their LDL-C goals,&quot; said Tim Mayleben, president and chief executive officer of Esperion. &quot;These additional analyses further affirm the efficacy and safety of our medicines for the millions of patients needing to lower their bad cholesterol.&quot; </p>
<p>
  NEXLETOL(TM) (bempedoic acid) Tablet </p>
<p>
  NEXLETOL is a first-in-class ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL) inhibitor that lowers LDL-C by reducing cholesterol biosynthesis and up-regulating LDL receptors. Phase 3 studies detailed in the label were conducted in more than 3,000 patients, with over 2,000 patients treated with NEXLETOL, demonstrated an average 18 percent placebo corrected LDL-C lowering when used in patients on moderate or high-intensity statins. NEXLETOL was approved by the FDA in February 2020. </p>
<p>
  Indication and Limitation of Use </p>
<p>
  NEXLETOL is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C. The effect of NEXLETOL on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. </p>
<p>
  Important Safety Information </p>
<p>
  -- Warnings and Precautions: </p>

<p>
  NEXLIZET(TM) (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) Tablet </p>
<p>
  NEXLIZET contains bempedoic acid and ezetimibe and lowers elevated LDL-C through complementary mechanisms of action by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver and absorption in the intestine. Phase 3 data demonstrated NEXLIZET lowered LDL-C by a mean of 38 percent compared to placebo when added on to maximally tolerated statins. NEXLIZET was approved by the FDA in February 2020. </p>
<p>
  Indication and Limitation of Use </p>
<p>
  NEXLIZET is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C. The effect of NEXLIZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. </p>
<p>

Press Release: Esperion Announces Three Data -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Esperion Therapeutics&apos; Commitment to Patients with Hyperlipidemia </p>
<p>
  High levels of LDL-C can lead to a build-up of fat and cholesterol in and on artery walls (known as atherosclerosis), potentially leading to cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke. In the U.S., 96 million people, or more than 37 percent of the adult population, have elevated LDL-C. There are approximately 18 million people in the U.S. living with elevated levels of LDL-C despite taking maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy -- including individuals considered statin averse -- leaving them at high risk for cardiovascular events(1) . In the United States, more than 50 percent of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) patients and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) patients who are not able to reach their guideline recommended LDL-C levels with statins alone need less than a 40 percent reduction to reach their LDL-C threshold goal(2) . </p>
<p>
  Esperion&apos;s mission as the Lipid Management Company is to deliver oral, once-daily medicines that complement existing oral drugs to provide the additional LDL-C lowering that these patients need. </p>
<p>
  Forward-Looking Statements </p>
<p>
  This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding the regulatory approval pathway for bempedoic acid tablet and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe fixed dose combination tablet, the therapeutic potential of, and the clinical development plan for bempedoic acid tablet and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe fixed dose combination tablet, including Esperion&apos;s timing, designs, plans for announcement of results regarding its CLEAR Outcomes study and other ongoing clinical studies for bempedoic acid tablet and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination fixed dose tablet, timing for the review and approval of the NDAs and the MAAs, and Esperion&apos;s expectations for the market for medicines to lower LDL-C, including the commercial launch and market adoption of bempedoic acid tablet and the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe fixed dose combination tablet, if approved. Any express or implied statements contained in this press release that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Esperion&apos;s actual results to differ significantly from those projected, including, without limitation, delays or failures in Esperion&apos;s studies, that positive results from a clinical study of bempedoic acid may not be sufficient for EMA approval or necessarily be predictive of the results of future or ongoing clinical studies, that notwithstanding the completion of Esperion&apos;s Phase 3 clinical development program for LDL-C lowering, the FDA or EMA require additional development in connection with seeking regulatory approval, or approval of an expanded indication, that existing cash resources may be used more quickly than anticipated, and the risks detailed in Esperion&apos;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Esperion disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release, other than to the extent required by law. </p>

New York City Must Shield Homeless From Coronavirus, Legal Aid Says</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Paul Berger </pre>
<p>
     Advocates are calling on New York City to provide hotel rooms for tens of thousands of homeless people so they can practice social distancing and self-quarantine in the epicenter of the nation&apos;s new coronavirus crisis. </p>
<p>
     The Legal Aid Society, a public-interest law firm, warned in a letter sent to the city Thursday and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that failing to act now will endanger shelter residents and workers and contribute to the spread of the disease. </p>
<p>
     New York City recorded more than 26,500 confirmed cases of the disease as of Friday, including at least 450 deaths. </p>
<p>
     So far, according to city officials, about 59 homeless people across 40 shelter locations have been confirmed to have the virus. At least two more homeless people living on the streets have also tested positive. </p>
<p>
     The first coronavirus-related death of a homeless person was recorded on March 24. Since then, at least one more homeless person has died. </p>
<p>
     A spokesman for the city&apos;s Department of Social Services, in a written statement, didn&apos;t respond directly to the Legal Aid Society letter. &quot;Across government, we are working in lockstep during unprecedented times to implement unprecedented solutions at a scale and speed never before seen,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     The spokesman said the city is trying to find nursing staff and thousands of thermometers to implement temperature checks and screenings at homeless intake centers and shelters. He said the city has put in place protocols to transfer homeless people experiencing symptoms to a hospital or to place them into isolation. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Now is not the time to fearmonger and point fingers,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Advocates say the city faces a crisis within a crisis as the virus spreads through the nation&apos;s largest homeless population, most of whom have few options for social distancing. </p>
<p>
     There are almost 80,000 homeless people living in New York City, according to the latest federal estimate. Most of those people live in shelters with varying degrees of privacy, ranging from communal dining areas to shared bathrooms and dormitories. </p>
<p>
     The Legal Aid Society warns that the coronavirus crisis is causing a surge in demand for beds as transient people are forced out of crowded living spaces and as jails and prisons reduce their populations. </p>
<p>
     Many of the city&apos;s homeless people are particularly vulnerable, advocates say, because they have higher-than-average rates of underlying conditions, such as lung disease, diabetes and compromised immune systems. </p>
<p>
     Shelly Nortz, deputy executive director for policy at the nonprofit Coalition for the Homeless, said the virus looks set to sweep through the community. &quot;There&apos;s a humanitarian crisis unfolding in New York City like we have never seen before,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Advocates are particularly concerned about the 19,000 people who, according to the Coalition for the Homeless, live in dormitories for single adults. Some dormitories sleep dozens of people in a room. The average dormitory, according to the city, shelters between eight to 12 people in a room. </p>
<p>
     The city says it has told shelter providers that wherever possible they should isolate people experiencing coronavirus symptoms in a separate room. </p>
<p>
     It has also set up 500 isolation units at four locations outside the shelter system. So far, city officials say, 110 people have been housed there. </p>
<p>
     Ms. Nortz though says some of the criteria the city has set for access to the isolation shelter units have prevented people from accessing them. Her group has identified other cases where people who are presumed to have coronavirus have been sent back to shelters where there isn&apos;t a place to isolate. </p>
<p>
     In his statement, the city&apos;s spokesman didn&apos;t answer questions about whether symptomatic people had been prevented from accessing isolation units or had been sent back to shelters where they couldn&apos;t isolate themselves. </p>
<p>
     The Legal Aid Society, in its letter, says the city is failing to properly screen residents or to provide basic cleaning supplies. It warns that by failing to protect dormitory residents&apos; health the city is violating a court order to provide safe shelter to homeless single adults. </p>

<p>
Investigational Drug Vericiguat Significantly Reduced the Risk of the Composite Endpoint of Heart Failure Hospitalization or Cardiovascular Death, Compared to Placebo, When Given in Combination with Available Heart Failure Therapies </p>
<p>
  Phase 3 VICTORIA Trial is the First Contemporary Outcomes Study Focused Exclusively on a Chronic Heart Failure Patient Population Following a Worsening Event </p>
<pre>
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 28, 2020-- </pre>
<p>
  Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced the presentation of results from the VICTORIA trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of its investigational drug vericiguat, an orally administered soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator being developed to treat patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and following a worsening event. VICTORIA is the first contemporary outcomes study focused exclusively on symptomatic chronic heart failure patients (ejection fraction &lt;45%) following a worsening event. Vericiguat is being jointly developed with Bayer AG. </p>
<p>
  Patients enrolled in VICTORIA were at high risk of hospitalization and cardiovascular death following a recent heart failure decompensation. Vericiguat, when given in combination with available heart failure therapies, met the primary efficacy endpoint of reducing the risk for the composite endpoint of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death in patients with worsening chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), compared to placebo. A hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-0.98) in this high risk population translated into a clinically relevant 4.2/100 patient-years absolute reduction in event rate. Based on this absolute risk reduction, the number needed to treat with vericiguat for one year to prevent a primary outcome event is approximately 24 patients. </p>
<p>
  &quot;For this group of chronic heart failure patients at high risk for future events, vericiguat has the potential to provide a significant addition to usual guideline-based treatment,&quot; said Paul W. Armstrong, M.D., cardiologist and Distinguished University Professor of Medicine at the Canadian VIGOUR Centre, University of Alberta, the study&apos;s lead author. &quot;We are pleased with the observed absolute risk reduction and are hopeful that this result may open up a new avenue for appropriate patients and a possible path for future discovery in cardiovascular heart disease.&quot; </p>
<p>
  &quot;VICTORIA builds on Merck&apos;s strong legacy of conducting large cardiovascular outcomes studies designed to answer meaningful questions. By enrolling patients receiving heart failure therapy following intervention for a worsening event such as rehospitalization or urgent outpatient treatment, VICTORIA was designed to study a serious medical problem not studied in any other recent heart failure outcomes study,&quot; said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. &quot;In the VICTORIA trial, vericiguat met its primary endpoint, achieving a significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in these patients overall when given in combination with available heart failure therapies.&quot; </p>
<p>
  The safety profile of vericiguat was consistent with that reported in previous studies. </p>
<p>
  These results were presented today at the virtual American College of Cardiology&apos;s 69(th) Annual Scientific Session Together With World Congress of Cardiology (ACC.20/WCC) and published in The New England Journal of Medicine. </p>
<p>
  Merck and Bayer plan to share VICTORIA data with regulatory authorities worldwide. </p>
<p>
  Study design and additional data from the VICTORIA trial (NCT02861534) </p>
<p>
  VICTORIA is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, double-blind, Phase 3 study of vericiguat versus placebo when given in combination with available heart failure therapies in patients with worsening chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV), a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;45% within 12 months prior to randomization, and elevated natriuretic peptide levels (determined by sites) within 30 days prior to randomization. For patients in sinus rhythm, plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels &gt;=300 pg/ml and NT-proBNP levels &gt;=1000 pg/ml were required. For those in atrial fibrillation, BNP levels &gt;=500 pg/ml and NT-proBNP &gt;=1600 pg/ml were required. Patients were required to have evidence of worsening heart failure and were classified into three cohorts based on the timing of their symptomatic worsening: &lt;3 months; 3--6 months after hospitalization; and those receiving intravenous diuretic therapy, without hospitalization, within the prior 3 months. </p>
<p>
  The primary endpoint of the study is the composite of time to first occurrence of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death. Secondary endpoints include time to occurrence of cardiovascular death, time to first occurrence of heart failure hospitalization, time to total heart failure hospitalizations (including first and recurrent events), time to the composite of all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization, and time to all-cause mortality. </p>
<p>
  The study enrolled a total of 5,050 patients who were randomized to receive either vericiguat once daily (titrated up to 10 mg) (n=2,526) or placebo (n=2,524) when given in combination with available heart failure therapies. The study, which was co-sponsored by Merck and Bayer, was conducted in collaboration with the Canadian VIGOUR Centre and the Duke Clinical Research Institute at more than 600 centers in 42 countries. </p>
<p>
  Over a median of 10.8 months, the incidence of cardiovascular death or heart failure-related hospitalization occurred in 897 (35.5%) patients receiving vericiguat and 972 (38.5%) receiving placebo (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.82--0.98; P=0.019). This effect was consistent across the majority of pre-specified subgroups, including patients receiving or not receiving sacubitril/valsartan. Levels of NT-proBNP at baseline and age were shown to correlate with the treatment effect. Here, the data suggest that the majority of patients in the study with NT-proBNP in the lower quartile ranges and those under 75 years of age may have achieved a greater benefit. </p>

<p>
  The safety profile of vericiguat was consistent with that reported in previous studies. The overall incidences of serious adverse events were similar for the vericiguat (32.8%) and placebo (34.8%) groups. Symptomatic hypotension (9.1% vs 7.9%) and syncope (4.0% vs 3.5%) tended to be more common with vericiguat than placebo, but the differences were not statistically significant. Throughout the VICTORIA study, there were no significant between-group differences for renal adverse events such as hyperkalemia or decreases in eGFR. The vericiguat safety profile was also similar when in combination with other therapies used in heart failure patients. </p>
<p>
  About Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction </p>
<p>
  Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), formerly known as systolic heart failure, is characterized by the compromised ability of the heart to eject blood sufficiently during its contraction phase. In the U.S., 6.5 million people have heart failure, and approximately 40-50% of these patients have HFrEF. Annually, approximately 30% of patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure will experience worsening of the disease, which is marked by progressive symptoms and/or a recent heart failure event. Approximately half of patients with worsening chronic HFrEF are rehospitalized within 30 days of a worsening event, and an estimated one in five patients with worsening chronic HFrEF will die within two years. </p>
<p>
  About the Worldwide Collaboration Between Bayer and Merck </p>
<p>
  Since October 2014, Bayer and Merck (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada) are in a worldwide collaboration in the field of sGC modulators. The collaboration brings together two leading companies that have stated their intent to fully evaluate this therapeutic class in areas of unmet medical need. The vericiguat program is being co-developed by Bayer and Merck. </p>

<text>
<p>
  Amgen Announces Positive Results At ACC.20/WCC From Phase 3B Study Of Repatha(R) (Evolocumab) In People Living With HIV Who Have High LDL-Cholesterol </p>
<p>
  Study Met Primary Endpoint (Change From Baseline in LDL-C) and All Secondary Endpoints </p>
<p>
  Repatha is the First PCSK9 Inhibitor to Demonstrate LDL-C Lowering Results in People Living with HIV </p>
<p>
  PR Newswire </p>
<p>
  THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., March 28, 2020 </p>
<p>
  THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., March 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced positive results from the EvolocumaB Effect on LDL-C LowerIng in SubJEcts with Human Immunodeficiency ViRus and INcreased Cardiovascular RisK (BEIJERINCK) study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Repatha(R) (evolocumab) in patients who are human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) and have high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) despite stable background lipid-lowering therapy.(1) The study demonstrated that treatment with Repatha significantly reduced LDL-C. The results were featured as an oral presentation during the virtual American College of Cardiology&apos;s 69(th) Annual Scientific Session from March 28-30, 2020 with publication in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) on March 30, 2020. </p>
<p>
  &quot;Certain antiretroviral treatments for HIV can increase LDL-C and change the lipid makeup of people living with HIV. This study increases our overall evidence base for Repatha, but also provides us with a better understanding of cholesterol management for this under-represented patient population,&quot; said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. &quot;These positive results show that Repatha can help these patients lower their LDL-C, one of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Results from the double-blind 24-week study show that in people living with HIV (PLHIV) with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, monthly treatment with Repatha reduced LDL-C by 56.9% from baseline compared to placebo, meeting its primary endpoint.(1) Patients treated with Repatha also demonstrated improved secondary outcomes versus placebo with 71.9% of patients achieving an LDL-C reduction of more than or equal to 50% from baseline and 65.4% of patients achieving an LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL.(1) No new safety concerns were identified in the BEIJERINCK trial.(1) The subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was comparable among both groups.(1) </p>
<p>
  &quot;Professional guidelines, including most recently those from the European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society, have called for greater research into the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors in specific populations, like people living with HIV. The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology multi-society cholesterol guidelines also identify HIV infection as a cardiovascular risk-enhancing factor,&quot; said Professor Franck Boccara, M.D., PhD, cardiologist and primary study investigator, Sorbonne Universit&#233;, Paris. &quot;This is the first Phase 3 study to demonstrate that a PCSK9 inhibitor can effectively and safely reduce LDL-C in people living with HIV at risk for cardiovascular disease who have high cholesterol level despite statin treatment. Addressing uncontrolled LDL-C in this high-risk patient population is critical to maintain the progress that has been achieved in improving the lives of people living with HIV.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Approximately 38 million individuals live with HIV worldwide, with 1.1 million in the United States.(2,3) Cardiovascular (CV) risk is estimated to be nearly double in PLHIV compared to individuals who don&apos;t have HIV, and PLHIV face significant health challenges at earlier ages than people who don&apos;t have HIV.(4) The global burden of HIV-associated cardiovascular disease has tripled over the past two decades, and it will continue to increase as the population of individuals living with HIV ages.(5) Today, 75 percent of PLHIV are over age 45.(6) </p>
<p>
  The Phase 3b BEIJERINCK study is part of Amgen&apos;s PROFICIO (Program to Reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular Outcomes Following Inhibition of PCSK9 In different pOpulations) program of clinical and real-world evidence (RWE) studies investigating the impact of Repatha and examining the use of lipid-lowering therapies across different patient populations. To date, the PROFICIO program consists of 35 clinical trials including more than 41,000 patients worldwide and more than 80 real-world evidence studies. </p>
<p>
  About BEIJERINCK Study Design </p>
<p>
  EvolocumaB Effect on LDL-C LowerIng in SubJEcts with Human Immunodeficiency ViRus and INcreased Cardiovascular RisK (BEIJERINCK) is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 420 mg once-monthly treatment with evolocumab in HIV+ patients with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia over 24 weeks. The study enrolled 467 adults with known HIV infection who have received stable HIV therapy for six months or more prior to randomization and have also been treated with maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy for four weeks or longer prior to randomization. Both background therapies were not expected to change during the duration of study participation. Statin-intolerant patients were also eligible for the study. Evolocumab-treated patients who completed the 24-week double-blind treatment period were enrolled in an open-label period through the end of the study at week 52. </p>
<p>
  About Repatha(R)  (evolocumab) </p>
<p>
  Repatha is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.(7) </p>
<p>
  Repatha is approved in more than 70 countries, including the U.S., Japan,  Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending. </p>
<p>
  Important U.S. Product Information </p>
<p>
  Repatha is a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor antibody indicated: </p>
<pre>
   -- to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary 
      revascularization in adults with established cardiovascular disease. 
 
   -- as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering 
      therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe), for treatment of adults with 
      primary hyperlipidemia (including heterozygous familial 
      hypercholesterolemia [HeFH]) to reduce low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (LDL-C). 
 
   -- as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, 
      ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial 
      hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C. </pre>
<p>
  The safety and effectiveness of Repatha have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old or in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH. </p>
<p>
  Important U.S. Safety Information </p>
<p>
  Contraindication: Repatha is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Repatha. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema have occurred in patients treated with Repatha. </p>
<p>
  Allergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. angioedema, rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with Repatha, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Repatha, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. </p>
<p>
  Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions (&gt;5% of patients treated with Repatha and occurring more frequently than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, back pain, and injection site reactions. </p>
<p>
  From a pool of the 52-week trial and seven 12-week trials: Local injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of Repatha-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising. </p>
<p>
  Allergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of Repatha-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for Repatha and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%). </p>
<p>
  The most common adverse reactions in the Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (&gt;5% of patients treated with Repatha and occurring more frequently than placebo) were: diabetes mellitus (8.8% Repatha, 8.2% placebo), nasopharyngitis (7.8% Repatha, 7.4% placebo), and upper respiratory tract infection (5.1% Repatha, 4.8% placebo). </p>
<p>
  Among the 16,676 patients without diabetes mellitus at baseline, the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus during the trial was 8.1% in patients assigned to Repatha compared with 7.7% in those assigned to placebo. </p>
<p>
  Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): The adverse reactions that occurred in at least two patients treated with Repatha and more frequently than placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, gastroenteritis, and nasopharyngitis. </p>

<p>
  Forward-Looking Statements </p>
<p>
  This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations with any other company, including BeiGene, Ltd., or the Otezla(R) (apremilast) acquisition, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on  Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. </p>
<p>
  No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project.  Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. </p>
<p>
  Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. </p>
<p>
  The scientific information discussed in this news release relating to any new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses. </p>

Press Release: Ryvu Therapeutics Receives Orphan Drug Designation From FDA for SEL120 to Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Ryvu Therapeutics Receives Orphan Drug Designation From FDA for SEL120 to Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia </p>
<p>
  PR Newswire </p>
<p>
  KRAKOW, Poland, March 28, 2020 </p>
<p>
  KRAKOW, Poland, March 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Ryvu Therapeutics (WSE: RVU), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel small molecule therapies that address emerging targets in oncology, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted an orphan drug designation (ODD) to Ryvu&apos;s SEL120, for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). </p>
<p>
  SEL120 is an oral, selective inhibitor of CDK8 kinase which is implicated in the development of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. A clinical phase 1b study of SEL120 is currently enrolling in 6 investigational sites in USA, investigating safety and preliminary efficacy of SEL120 in treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). </p>
<p>
  &quot;The FDA&apos;s granting orphan drug designation to SEL120, is a significant encouragement for advancement of our clinical strategic plan addressing the unmet medical needs in the area of AML treatment, a disease where patients still face poor prognosis&quot; said Setareh Shamsili, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer and Executive VP at Ryvu Therapeutics. &quot;SEL120 has shown strong proof of concept in the preclinical studies and has received a strategic support from The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (LLS) through its Therapy Acceleration Program(R) (TAP). SEL120 may have the potential to offer an important therapeutic benefit in AML and in particular to those refractory/relapsed AML patients with the poorest prognosis, worldwide.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Orphan drug status (ODD) is intended to advance drug development for rare diseases. The FDA provides ODD to drugs and biologics that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. The FDA&apos;s orphan drug designation allows the drug for the designated indication to be eligible for requesting a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity upon approval of the drug, as well as potential of other development assistance and financial incentives: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/detailedIndex.cfm?cfgridkey=733220. </p>
<p>
  About SEL120 </p>
<p>
  SEL120 is an oral, selective inhibitor of CDK8, a kinase which is a part of the mediator complex and is essential for the activity of super-enhancers important to the regulation of RNA transcription. CDK8 kinase is implicated in the development of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. SEL120 was discovered with the Ryvu Therapeutics discovery engine platform and is currently in Phase 1b study in adult patients with AML or HR-MDS who are refractory to treatment or have relapsed after previous therapies. Patients are enrolled in the study independent of specific tumor mutational burden. The study will also assess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of SEL120. </p>
<p>
  SEL120 has received support from The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society Therapy Acceleration Program(R) (TAP), a strategic initiative to partner directly with innovative biotechnology companies and leading research institutions to accelerate the development of promising new therapies for blood cancers. More information about TAP program is available at: https://www.lls.org/therapy-acceleration-program </p>
<p>
  About Acute Myeloid Leukemia </p>
<p>
  Acute myelogenous leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous hematological malignancy involving the clonal expansion of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood with possible spread to liver and spleen. It is estimated that there are around 90 000 cases of AML worldwide each year, and American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 20 000 of these in U.S. only. The median age at diagnosis is 66 years, with 54% patients over 65 years, and 33% over 75 years. Of those diagnosed at a later age, the diagnosis is often associated with underlying myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), sometimes linked to cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy exposure. </p>
<p>
  About Ryvu Therapeutics </p>
<p>
  Ryvu Therapeutics is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel small molecule therapies that address emerging targets in oncology. Pipeline candidates make use of diverse therapeutic mechanisms driven by emerging knowledge of cancer biology, including small molecules directed at kinase, synthetic lethality, immuno-oncology and cancer metabolism targets. SEL120 is a selective CDK8 kinase inhibitor with potential for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors currently in clinical development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. SEL24/MEN1703 is a dual PIM/FLT3 kinase inhibitor licensed to the Menarini Group in clinical development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

What an Hawaiian Family Vacation Is Like in the Middle of an Epidemic -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Al Root </pre>
<p>
     Hawaii was our once-in-a-decade blowout family vacation. We sold our house -- in Greenwich, Conn., no less, which is still, incredibly, recovering from the effects of the financial crisis. Some of our newfound liquidity was put into current consumption, trading future household square footage for an experience. YOLO. </p>
<p>
     When we left New York&apos;s John F. Kennedy International Airport on March 16, there were less than 2,000 Covid-19 cases in the U.S., according to the World Health Organization. Washington state was the hardest-hit region of the country. There were a handful of cases in the state of Hawaii -- less than 10. Things looked OK. (In fact, we were told we couldn&apos;t defer the trip by our hotels and resorts.) </p>
<p>
     Things then escalated quickly. And the rapid, escalating response of Hawaiian officials tells a story about how the Aloha State balances its economy with human welfare. It also demonstrates how a people with a history of geographic and physical vulnerability reacts to new threats. </p>
<p>
     My little gaggle -- another parent, two teens, and one still bearable child -- was headed to two islands after landing on Oahu. First, the Big Island -- also known as Hawaii -- home to the world&apos;s largest active volcano. Then, after a couple of days, off to Kauai -- home to the iconic Na Pali coast as well as the 3,600-foot-deep Waimea canyon. </p>
<p>
     After a short hop from Oahu on Hawaiian Airlines, our first stop was Volcano Village on the island of Hawaii. The name sounds like something out of a Walt Disney theme park. The flora and design look like a theme park, except it&apos;s real and much larger. The Kilauea Iki trail hike, for instance, covers four miles into and across a volcanic crater. The hardened lava lake looks flat from the starting point 400 feet above on the crater rim, but it isn&apos;t. </p>
<p>
     On our arrival in Volcano Village, we learned local schools were already suspended. Restaurants were still serving eat-in meals. But the next day that had changed, and takeout only per the mandate from local officials. The same officials closed the state parks and beaches too. This was before 20 cases were confirmed in the state and before pockets of the U.S. mainland took similar steps. </p>
<p>
     &quot;If the virus spreads here, it would be devastating,&quot; said Barbara Sarban, a local schoolteacher with ties to a nonprofit in New York state. &quot;There are only a couple hundred hospital beds on the island.&quot; </p>
<p>
     There are actually a few hundred beds on the Big Island, but her point is valid: It can&apos;t handle a large outbreak. That&apos;s part of the reason she believes officials underreacted to a couple of confirmed cases on her home island. Sarban wants to see hotels closed and offering refunds or deferments to guests. </p>
<p>
     Her views turned out to be prescient. Half her students were already at home before the schools officially closed. &quot;A lot of elders live with their families,&quot; added Sarban. The structure of the society in Hawaii means the stakes for community transmission of Covid-19 were too high. The locals seemed to recognize that fact as soon as the outbreak gained steam on the mainland. </p>
<p>
     She hated the closure of the state parks, though. &quot;We need nature closening along with social distancing,&quot; said Sarban. &quot;People need to be outside,&quot; though she acknowledged the goal of the closings was to dissuade tourists from arriving. </p>
<p>
     A few days later, after two more flights -- one from Hawaii to Maui and another from Maui to Kauai -- we arrived to a 9 p.m. curfew put in place by the Kauai local government. Over the next couple of days, Oahu officials issued an order for any visitors from the mainland or overseas to quarantine for 14 days, effectively shutting down tourism in the state. </p>
<p>
     I tried to contact the governor and the Kauai mayor. Kauai officials responded with &quot; mahalo,&quot; the traditional Hawaiian expression of gratitude, but referred us to existing news releases because they were &quot;beyond capacity.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;I can&apos;t see anyone else checking in,&quot; said our valet at the first of our Kauai stops. The resort was operating at 25% capacity. Occupancy was going to, effectively, zero over the next week. The resort&apos;s 300-strong staff was reduced to a handful. The fate of the rest? Unemployment insurance for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>
     After the curfew was put in place, officials closed helicopter and boat tours. I believe my family was on the last boat tour of the Na Pali coast before the halt. The only reason our tour wasn&apos;t canceled was it was just us -- a group of seven, including the two pontoon boat operators. </p>
<p>
     For anyone unfamiliar with the Na Pali coast, go back to the opening island scene of the first Jurassic Park film. The green knife-edge peaks rising 4,000 feet from the Pacific are where Steven Spielberg chose to set his adventure epic. </p>
<p>
     Our boat operators weren&apos;t allowed -- by virtue of state park closings -- to land on any beaches, so we had to content ourselves with spinner dolphins, a baby humpback whale, and mammoth sea caves carved out by the Pacific surf. </p>
<p>
     Our boat operators -- two women born around the time my wife and I started dating -- also said unemployment benefits were next. &quot;At least I don&apos;t have a family to take care of,&quot; added the captain. Both women were what is best described as fairly chill about the whole situation. </p>
<p>
     Chill wasn&apos;t an uncommon reaction to pending economic fallout. The pain from a looming shutdown of a massive portion of Hawaii&apos;s economy -- tourism -- was met with relative equanimity. The reasons for such a reaction, as best I could tell, were twofold: an awareness of native vulnerability, and a strong sense of ohana, the Hawaiian word for family. </p>
<p>
     Measles, for instance, wiped out half the native Hawaiian population in the 19th century. Devastating epidemics are still remembered on the islands today. In fact, we were treated to a Hawaii protest on Saturday with native Hawaiians asking us to &quot;go home now&quot; to &quot;protect our elders&quot; and reminding us that &quot;Aloha also means goodbye.&quot; The protest was peaceful and, in friendly Hawaii fashion, the protesters literally said &quot;please.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The mandated 14-day visitor quarantine, and not the protests, is what shut tourism, sending people home. It won&apos;t be easy for the islands. Roughly 20% of Hawaiian jobs are directly, or indirectly, tied to tourism. That number probably understates the impact. Tourism is the economic engine of the state. Hawaii&apos;s population is about 1.4 million. About 10 million people visit the state each year. </p>
<p>
     Everyone knows pain is coming. The question &quot;How&apos;s business,&quot; was consistently answered &quot;Slow,&quot; whether it was at a local shaved-ice outlet or one of the few stores still open to pedal flip-flops and sunscreen. Slow was an understatement. &quot;Crickets,&quot; as my teens would say, was more like it. Nothing was going on by the end of the vacation. </p>
<p>
     Fear, of course, was also expressed by some businesses -- mainly by local retailers worried about an existential crisis. Restaurants appeared to be in better shape, with the bulk of the pain felt by hourly employees. Groceries were still doing brisk business. </p>
<p>
     Overall, there was an absence of vitriol for the governor or local government. The vast majority of those I spoke with supported the moves. Some vitriol, in fact, was reserved for not acting faster. There was more concern about the health of elders than the health of the economy. </p>
<p>
     That&apos;s the attitude which can be a good model for the rest of the country. </p>
<p>
     Hawaii, which became the 50th state only about 60 years ago, still has a very different culture from the mainland. There is a recognition by all age groups: Ohana requires sacrifice. There is also a serene belief that things will be better down the road. </p>
<p>
     Optimism in trying times is another good lesson of all for those of us who spend all our time worrying about stock markets and the global economy. Unemployment is going to spike, in Hawaii and on the mainland. And it will take a shared effort at all levels of society and government to recover. But things will be better down the road. </p>
<p>
     What about the Hawaiian stocks? Hawaiian Airlines&apos; parent company, Hawaiian Holdings (ticker: HA), is down about 62% year to date. Bank of Hawaii (BOH) is off about 41%. Both declines are worse than the drops of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500. What&apos;s more, Hawaiian municipal bonds have dropped about 5% in recent weeks. They still yield less than 2%. No one, it appears, expects the state to run into trouble. </p>
<p>
     As for the virus: There were about 70 cases on the islands as of Tuesday evening, local time. when we returned home. There are about 100 cases as of Friday evening. Growth in the number of cases has slowed over the past couple of days. It isn&apos;t yet a trend, or victory, but it&apos;s good news. </p>

Ways Older Adults Can Cope With the Stress of Coronavirus</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Clare Ansberry </pre>
<p>
     With the new coronavirus targeting older adults, how can they best cope and how can their adult children help them? </p>
<p>
     Brian Carpenter, who is a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., has given those questions a lot of thought. Dr. Carpenter is a geropsychologist, which means he specializes in treating older adults. He&apos;s also the son of parents ages 77 and 78, who live in upstate New York. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I&apos;ll admit I&apos;ve been one of those &apos;bossy&apos; adult children who has lectured his parents about social-distancing and hygiene, but have also shared recommendations about stress management, staying physically active while at home, how to stay engaged intellectually. So I hope I&apos;m practicing what I&apos;m preaching!&quot; he says. </p>
<p>
     In general, older adults are resilient and shouldn&apos;t be treated as frail and helpless, even if the pandemic has taken its greatest toll on those 65 and older, says Dr. Carpenter, who is 55. &quot;They&apos;ve developed a series of strategies and skills over their lifetime to help them maintain their well-being even in the face of chronic illness and life transitions like retirement,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>
     Geropsychology is a relatively new specialty in the field of psychology and was developed to meet the special needs of older adults dealing with the normal aging process and facing illness, loss and isolation. The field is relatively small -- about 4% of all psychologists are geropsychologists, says Dr. Carpenter, president of the Society of Clinical Geropsychology, which has assembled a coronavirus resource page with information for older adults and their family members. </p>
<p>
     In an edited interview, Dr. Carpenter discusses how older adults can cope during the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     What are your concerns about the new coronavirus and its impact on older adults and their mental health? </p>
<p>
     There are two things going on. Older adults understand that exposure to the coronavirus places them at greater risk than younger people. So there is a higher level of threat and sense of worry among older adults because of that. </p>
<p>
     The second issue involves social connection. There are restrictions in long-term care facilities about visitors, and recommendations for older adults in the community to keep physical distance from family members and friends. We do worry about social isolation and loneliness, which can have direct physical consequences on our biology and reduce immune functioning. </p>
<p>
     Can technology help people feel more connected and less isolated? </p>
<p>
     We are still trying to figure out whether and how technology is going to be a solution to this. I know a lot of older adults who group chat and make video conference calls that younger people are using to stay in touch. But there will be a subset of older adults who will not have access to or know how to use those technologies. </p>
<p>
     What can adult children do to help? </p>
<p>
     I would love it if family members would ask their parents: How do you want to stay in touch? How often? What time? By what mode? What do you want to talk about? What do you not want to talk about? Just asking can be informative and empowering. </p>
<p>
     Are phone calls or video calls better? </p>
<p>
     Those two technologies serve different purposes and might be most effectively used in combination. There are times when you really want to see someone and check in on someone and see how they look. There are other times when a very brief phone call to ask &quot;How are you doing? Do you need anything?&quot; is enough. In terms of therapy, video therapy is more beneficial than telephone therapy and telephone therapy is more beneficial than email. All are more effective than nothing at all. </p>
<p>
     Is there anything people shouldn&apos;t talk about? </p>
<p>
     No, but I think you want to be deliberate. You don&apos;t want to call up and talk about all the alarming statistics you read all morning. I would be deliberate with people of all ages. </p>
<p>
     How can you protect your parents without infantilizing them? </p>
<p>
     We&apos;re going to see a lot of interesting negotiations in families about who is doing what for whom and why. Having an explicit conversation about that would be helpful. Adult children may be trying to be helpful by offering support and services. Maybe that&apos;s to protect their parents. </p>
<p>
     But maybe it&apos;s also to allay their own anxiety and worry and give them a sense they are doing something helpful. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that. But they need to pause and ask, &quot;Am I doing this for my parents or for me or for both of us?&quot; Be honest about it. </p>
<p>
     What about older adults who don&apos;t have family? </p>
<p>
     This is a time when community -- large and small -- can step up to help support older adults who don&apos;t have family. The community in the apartment buildings where someone lives, or a next-door neighbor. The communities of social service organizations and institutions, who can identify a person in need. </p>
<p>
     We have a student organization on our campus, a local chapter of &quot;Adopt a Grandparent,&quot; where students do volunteer work with residents at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Our students are no longer here in St. Louis, but the organization is talking with administrators to see how our students can send pictures of themselves, cards, letters and videos to stay in touch with them. </p>
<p>
     How does the uncertainty around the virus play into concerns and anxiety? </p>
<p>
     We&apos;re learning new things every day. We don&apos;t know about the trajectory of the illness. We don&apos;t know how much of what we are experiencing now will disappear. Or how much will become a new kind of normal. That creates a degree of uncertainty that leaves everyone wondering about the future. </p>
<p>
     How can older adults manage those unknowns? </p>
<p>
     One way is to focus on what we do know: That the virus is highly contagious. That most people who get the virus recuperate fine, although some people are at higher risk for serious consequences. That there are things people can do to protect themselves and their community. And that there are many, many people available to help anyone who is feeling stressed and anxious, for whatever reason. Family and friends can help, as can medical, mental health, and service providers throughout the community. </p>
<p>
     If older adults can keep their focus on what they can do to promote their physical and mental well being, that can help reduce anxiety. It can also be helpful for older adults to think about what they can do for other people -- make a phone call, send an email, yell down the hall to another friend who is self-quarantining. Again, a focus on what we all can do can help reverse the kind of pessimism and hopelessness that&apos;s at the root of so many mental-health symptoms. </p>
<p>
     What do older adults need most in these uncertain times? </p>
<p>
     That&apos;s a big question. The older adults I talk to want to know they are not alone. They want to know people are there for them if they need them. Some of them want to know this will end. They know it will be different after this is over, and there will be a new normal. </p>
<p>
     I think there are also older adults who recognize this as one event in a life that has unfolded over many decades. They take more of philosophical perspective. In that way, they have the opportunity to help younger people think about it in that way, too. </p>
<p>
     Tips for Handling the Crisis </p>
<p>
     Structure your days. Try to find a routine that is as normal as possible. Don&apos;t stay in bed. Don&apos;t oversleep. Get up. Take a shower. Make your bed. Set your goals for the day and develop a plan to meet them. Don&apos;t forget to schedule activities that you enjoy. </p>
<p>
     Stay in touch. Use whatever medium is most comfortable to you. If you don&apos;t want people to see you, stick to the phone and skip the video calls. Reach out to people who don&apos;t have family. If you can&apos;t call, email or text. Any communication is better than none. </p>
<p>
     Stay positive. Express gratitude. Pay attention to small joys and pleasures. Create positive experiences for yourself during the day. </p>
<p>
     Limit coronavirus news intake. Pick a couple of trusted news sources and one or two times during the day to check on them. Don&apos;t leave the news on in the background and shut screens off an hour before going to bed. </p>
<p>
     Maintain the basics: Exercise, eat healthy foods and get plenty of sleep. </p>

Watch This Corner of the Mortgage Market Closely -- Heard on the Street</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Telis Demos </pre>
<p>
     Among the hardest-hit victims of funding-market troubles have been mortgage-investment firms. What happens to them will shed light on what may be in store for the rest of the market. </p>
<p>
     A handful of real-estate investment trusts that buy mortgages or mortgage-backed securities, called mortgage REITs, have reported margin calls by the banks that finance them. These firms are doubly exposed to the market right now. First, their core assets have seen spreads widen, liquidity plunge and prices drop. Second, they typically leverage themselves by using the repurchase-agreement, or repo, market, where the cost of financing has been volatile, especially for terms longer than overnight. </p>
<p>
     Given that mortgage REITs are required to pay out their cash to shareholders as part of their favorable tax treatment, they typically have little cash in reserve. When banks make margin calls, these REITs either have to raise cash or pledge more loans or securities. </p>
<p>
     This dynamic leaves banks in a tough position. Waves of selling by these firms only contribute to lower prices. But accepting or seizing more collateral also would put pressure on their balance sheets. Big dealer banks&apos; books are already working overtime as the Federal Reserve tries to push liquidity out to the broader market. </p>
<p>
     So far, firms appear to have mostly been able to work out with their banks ways to forestall the forced turnover or liquidation of assets. In one case, AG Mortgage Investment Trust received margin calls and had sought to block a sale of its securities held by a bank. On Friday the company said it had sold some securities itself to cover repo obligations and was in further discussions with financing counterparties for forbearance. </p>
<p>
     If real-estate investors are able to successfully work through these challenges, it may be a good illustration of how the Covid-19 crisis isn&apos;t exactly following the 2008 financial crisis playbook. In the time leading up to the crisis, many observers still believed banks could outlast problems in the subprime mortgage market. Banks were widely shutting off short-term funding to subprime mortgage lenders and taking on huge amounts of those assets -- moves that ultimately threatened the banks, too. </p>
<p>
     Now banks are much more protective of their balance sheets, both through their own caution and tighter regulation. Plus, the Fed has made a massive early commitment to the market, including for certain mortgage assets, well ahead of a banking crisis. </p>
<p>
     If banks are indeed lenient with the mortgage REITs, it is a hopeful sign for the containment of risk to individual companies, for banks&apos; risk management, and for the Fed&apos;s backstopping success. It also would be an important read-through for banks&apos; exposures to a much wider range of nonbank lenders through other forms of leverage, such as warehouse financing, which clients draw on to fund loans until they are sold via securitizations. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Liquidating collateral doesn&apos;t behoove anybody,&quot; says Eric Hagen, analyst at KBW. &quot;Banks are certainly capable of doing that, but it&apos;s not what they want to do.&quot; </p>
<p>
     However, the price of this stability also could mean prolonged disruption more broadly. For example, one mortgage firm, Two Harbors Investment, this week announced it had sold most of its portfolio of nonagency mortgage securities, which are those that don&apos;t have backing from the Fed, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. That furnishes the firm with cash to fund the rest of its portfolio and likely keeps it in good stead with its financiers. </p>
<p>
     But more moves like that might also represent the drying up of funding sources for parts of the mortgage market, putting that much more pressure on the Fed&apos;s and Congress&apos;s efforts to spread money around directly. </p>

A Global Downturn Will Test Investors&apos; Taste for Liquor -- Heard on the Street</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Carol Ryan </pre>
<p>
     Investors are showing a preference for liquor stocks over beer in the global health crisis. A drawn-out recession might change their tastes. </p>
<p>
     Shares of listed liquor companies fell when the Covid-19 outbreak emerged in China, but they have since outperformed their beer peers. On average, Diageo, Pernod Ricard, R&#233;my Cointreau and Davide Campari-Milano have lost 15% of their stock-market value this year. Brewers Anheuser-Busch InBev, Heineken, Carlsberg and Constellation Brands are down 30% by comparison. </p>
<p>
     Worries about AB InBev&apos;s huge debt burden drag down the beer companies&apos; average, and a 30-day ban on short-selling in France may flatter Paris-listed R&#233;my Cointreau and Pernod Ricard. But there are underlying forces at play too: R&#233;my&apos;s share price has rallied 23% over the past two weeks because of its exposure to China, where bars and restaurants are reopening. </p>
<p>
     Liquor stocks look safer in the short term. Beer companies are slightly more exposed to lockdowns that are closing bars and restaurants globally. AB InBev and Heineken make 34% and 38% of sales through the so-called on-trade respectively, based on analysis at Citi. That compares with 37% at R&#233;my Cointreau and 29% for Diageo and Campari. As brewers have a higher percentage of fixed costs than distillers -- notably because bulkier, lower-value beer is more expensive to transport -- the drop in sales has an outsize impact on profit margins. </p>
<p>
     Heineken and AB InBev have big businesses in markets including Brazil, Mexico and Vietnam, where the spread of Covid-19 is at an earlier stage. On-trade consumption in emerging markets could drop 94% in April if there is a fresh wave of compulsory lockdowns, according to Bernstein estimates. This would hit Pernod Ricard&apos;s large Indian business too, however. </p>
<p>
     Liquor companies may face pain later in the year. In theory, they should recoup some lost sales in the third and fourth quarters, provided lockdowns are lifted. Liquor is slightly seasonal, with demand picking up around Thanksgiving and Christmas. But wholesalers must clear unsold stock before they can place new orders, which may delay brands&apos; recovery. Brewers should rebound more quickly, as beer&apos;s shorter shelf life means bars carry less inventory. </p>
<p>
     Exposure to travel retail is another issue. Liquor companies make 5% to 10% of total sales in duty-free hubs such as airports, based on Citi estimates, while beer companies do little business in this channel. In a profit warning this week, Jameson maker Pernod Ricard said it assumes travel retail sales will be down 80% until the end of June. </p>
<p>
     Liquor stocks tend to do well when economic growth is strong and consumers are trading up to premium brands. Beer consumption is usually more defensive during downturns. If the global economy suffers lasting damage in the pandemic, investors will be tempted to switch drinks. </p>

Global Economic Fallout Grows as Coronavirus Cases Pass 600,000 -- 2nd Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jimmy Vielkind and Stella Yifan Xie </pre>
<p>
     President Trump approved a disaster declaration for Michigan and Massachusetts on Saturday as the number of infections globally topped 600,000 and concerns grew about the financial toll of the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The two states now have the fifth- and sixth-most infections, respectively, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The disaster designation, which was also extended to the island territory of Guam, makes local governments eligible for additional federal funding. </p>
<p>
     The moves come a day after Mr. Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus plan, the largest economic relief package in history. </p>
<p>
     The highest number of U.S. cases continues to be in the state of New York, where almost 45,000 people have been infected and 519 have died from the virus as of Friday, state officials said. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York amid increased testing. The growth outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second- and third-most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000, respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections there rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>
<p>
     Overlapping travel bans and lockdowns have hammered businesses and led to millions of job losses, punctuated by a spike in U.S. unemployment claims to more than three million this week and a warning of a deep recession this year in trade bellwether Singapore. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009,&quot; Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said Friday. Rising bankruptcies and layoffs could undermine any recovery and do long-lasting damage to the world economy, she said. </p>
<p>
     With the pneumonia-causing virus spreading across the U.S. and Europe, after it was first detected in central China three months ago, governments around the world have ramped up efforts to limit people&apos;s movement and began imposing wide-ranging closures on businesses, restaurants and schools domestically in recent weeks. </p>
<p>
     Increasingly strict travel bans set up by large countries including the U.S. and China have put a dent in global commerce, complicating efforts to reignite growth. </p>
<p>
     France and Belgium on Friday extended their national lockdowns by two weeks, until mid-April. French Prime Minister &#201;douard Philippe said experts advising the government recommended the lockdown remain for at least six weeks. Russia on Friday suspended all passenger flights to and from the country. </p>
<p>
     The IMF warned that low-income countries will be hit particularly hard given a combination of a health crisis, sudden reversal of capital flows and in some cases a plunge in commodity prices. In Russia, where oil exports account for roughly one-third of government revenue, the ruble has fallen to its lowest level in four years. The IMF estimated that at least $2.5 trillion is needed to contain economic contraction for emerging markets. </p>
<p>
     The Chinese government is also wrestling with the economic blow from the SARS-like virus, first from a prolonged halt in domestic business activities and now from weaker consumer sentiment and shrinking export demand as the coronavirus engulfs Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, China&apos;s top decision-making body said the government plans to boost spending by increasing its fiscal deficit this year, as well as speed up issuance of Treasury bonds and so-called local government special-purpose bonds to support funding of infrastructure projects, as part of the stimulus measures to curtail economic impact from the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The fiscal policy needs to be more proactive, and the prudent monetary policy needs to be more flexible,&quot; said a statement from Friday&apos;s meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, chaired by President Xi Jinping. The government also called for a gradual reopening of shopping malls and markets to boost consumer spending. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 54 new infections Friday, saying all were imported from abroad, bringing the total to 81,394. </p>
<p>
     Other countries continue to tighten rules on social distancing. Iran this week closed shopping centers and banned road travel between cities, pledging to fine and impound the cars of offenders. Iranian officials have warned the population to brace for a second wave of infections. Afghanistan on Friday expanded restrictions by announcing a three-week lockdown on its capital, Kabul. Lebanon, which extended its nationwide lockdown until April 12, on Friday imposed a nighttime curfew. </p>
<p>
     In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan introduced further travel restrictions this weekend to combat the spread of the virus, which has infected 5,698 people and killed 92 in the country, according to a tally by national health authorities. Intercity bus and air traffic will be reduced to a minimum while all international flights will be suspended. </p>
<p>
     Hong Kong banned public gatherings of four or more people beginning midnight Sunday, with those violating the rules facing fines of more than $3,000 and six months in jail. Singapore said it would fine people who violate its social distancing rules up to about $7,000. </p>
<p>
     Australia said it would quarantine citizens returning from overseas in hotels for 14 days beginning midnight Saturday. </p>

Navigating Your Life During Coronavirus</headline>
<text>
<p>
     As the coronavirus pandemic upends work, travel and home life, the rules are shifting for what people can and can&apos;t do in their daily lives. The WSJ is continuously updating advice and information on how to stay safe, healthy and connected and how to help others. Here&apos;s our latest news, answering your questions: </p>
<p>
     STAY HEALTHY </p>
<p>
     The Risks of Visits to the Grocery Store </p>
<p>
     With communities across the country virtually shut down, there is still one place nearly everyone needs to visit at some point: the grocery store. Experts say deliveries are safer, but sometimes it can be hard to get one scheduled right away. So if you must go to the store, what&apos;s the best way to navigate the aisles and crowds? We asked the experts. Among their tips: </p>
<p>
     --Try to minimize visits to the store. &quot;The biggest risk factor is really being around other people,&quot; says Benjamin Chapman, a professor of food safety at North Carolina State University. </p>
<p>
     --Many grocery stores are providing shoppers with wipes. If not, it&apos;s a good idea to bring your own, mainly to wipe the grocery cart. </p>
<p>
     --Try to avoid exchanging money or credit cards with the cashier. Use a credit card reader when possible. </p>
<p>
     --People over 65 and those who have medical conditions that put them at greater risk of hospitalization and serious illness should avoid going to the grocery store, if possible. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Answers on Home Food Delivery </p>
<p>
     As the virus keeps people away from restaurants and grocery stores, more people are turning to deliveries. We&apos;e dug into what you need to know about ordering food. Among the tips: </p>
<p>
     --Ordering food is generally safer than going to a grocery store or a restaurant. </p>
<p>
     --There appears to be no risk of contracting the virus by eating it in cooked food. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     How Older Adults Can Cope During the Pandemic </p>
<p>
     With the new coronavirus targeting older adults, how can they best cope and how can their adult children help them? Brian Carpenter, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., has given those questions a lot of thought. He is a geropsychologist, which means he specializes in treating older adults. He&apos;s also the son of parents ages 77 and 78. In an edited interview, Dr. Carpenter discusses how older adults can cope during the pandemic. Here are some of the questions he answered: </p>
<p>
     How can you protect your parents without infantilizing them? </p>
<p>
     We&apos;re going to see a lot of interesting negotiations in families about who is doing what for whom and why. Having an explicit conversation about that would be helpful. Adult children may be trying to be helpful by offering support and services. Maybe that&apos;s to protect their parents. </p>
<p>
     But maybe it&apos;s also to allay their own anxiety and worry and give them a sense they are doing something helpful. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that. But they need to pause and ask, &quot;Am I doing this for my parents or for me or for both of us?&quot; Be honest about it. </p>
<p>
     What about older adults who don&apos;t have family? </p>
<p>
     This is a time when community -- large and small -- can step up to help support older adults who don&apos;t have family. The community in the apartment buildings where someone lives, or a next-door neighbor. The communities of social service organizations and institutions, who can identify a person in need. We have a student organization on our campus, a local chapter of &quot;Adopt a Grandparent,&quot; where students do volunteer work with residents at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Our students are no longer here in St. Louis, but the organization is talking with administrators to see how our students can send pictures of themselves, cards, letters and videos to stay in touch with them. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Five Home Workouts to Try </p>
<p>
     Experts say it&apos;s important to still get exercise while we&apos;re hunkered down. We found these specially designed workouts you can do at home for beginners or gym rats with different amounts of space and equipment. </p>
<p>
     Here&apos;s one instructor&apos;s advice for people stuck at home jonesing for yoga: </p>
<p>
     Simple cross-legged position </p>
<p>
     &quot;This pose teaches us to sit calmly in the entirety of the moment, even in fear,&quot; the instructor says. Place your hands on the tops of your thighs for extra grounding. </p>
<p>
     Cat-cow breath </p>
<p>
     Start on your hands and knees with your wrists directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips. On an inhale, lift your heart up to the ceiling, arching the back, coming into cow pose. On an exhale, round the spine into cat pose. </p>
<p>
     Humble warrior </p>
<p>
     Start in warrior one pose, with your right leg forward, knee bent over ankle, and left leg straight and strong behind, foot turned out to a 45-degree angle. Clasp both hands behind your lower back. As you bend your chest forward inside of your right knee, bring your arms overhead. Repeat on the opposite side. </p>
<p>
     Camel </p>
<p>
     Kneel with hips over knees and toes tucked (flat for more of a challenge). Place your hands on the small of your back and slowly drop your head and shoulders backward toward the wall. If comfortable, reach down to hold the heels of your feet. </p>
<p>
     Reclined cobbler </p>
<p>
     Lie on your back. Bend your knees, opening your thighs out to the side and bringing the soles of your feet together. Place one hand on your heart and the other hand onto your belly. Breathe here for five to seven minutes. See four other workouts here. </p>
<p>
     Tricks to Cook, Shop and Snack Smarter </p>
<p>
     For many newly remote employees, working steps away from a (now) fully stocked kitchen looks a lot like an all-day buffet. We asked top nutritionists and chefs for their suggestions on eating in the weeks ahead. Plus, how to eat if you want to sleep better. </p>
<p>
     --Don&apos;t be afraid of fruits and veggies. During the recent weeks of frenzied shopping, one nutrition expert noticed that fresh produce went largely untouched, even though some varieties are much less perishable. Hearty options include bell peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, bananas, apples and citrus fruit. </p>
<p>
     --Boost nutrition content. There&apos;s nothing wrong with cooking boxed pasta and jarred sauce, says celebrity chef Alex Guarnaschelli. &quot;The trick is to be clever about inserting protein.&quot; Stir in canned tuna, minestrone soup or quinoa. </p>
<p>
     --Snack better. Choose items with higher nutrition density, such as nuts or chopped veggies, which will be more filling. A bowl of frozen dark cherries makes a sweet dessert, recommends one dietitian. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Answers to Your Coronavirus Health Questions: Updates </p>
<p>
     With the scale and impact of the pandemic changing daily, we&apos;re continuously answering readers&apos; health questions. Your Health columnist Sumathi Reddy tackles many more questions on how to stay healthy here. And, as the science evolves, we&apos;re updating what we know here. </p>
<p>
     Today&apos;s Q&amp;A: Should parents grappling with school closures rely on grandparents for child care? This is a tough one. Older people are at the highest risk of developing serious illness and potential complications, or dying, from Covid-19. Children, meanwhile, appear to have few and sometimes no symptoms, making it hard to know if they are even infected. There&apos;s no data yet showing that children are transmitting the virus to older people but they are a large source of infection for other respiratory viruses. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Is there anybody else that can potentially take care of the children?&quot; suggests Andrew Janowski, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Washington University School of Medicine and St. Louis Children&apos;s Hospital. </p>
<p>
     Still, he and other experts acknowledge that for many families there may be no alternative. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the division of infectious disease at Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital in Boston, says if the family is living together and no one is commuting with the potential for outside exposure, that lessens the risk. &quot;People have to figure out a way of coping and there&apos;s not going to be an ideal solution for everybody. Presumably now that kids are going to be home there&apos;s hopefully less opportunity for them to become infected,&quot; he says. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     HELP OTHERS </p>
<p>
     How to Aid Hospitals, Doctors and Nurses </p>
<p>
     The second installment of the How You Can Help column takes a look at how regular people can help fill the medical supply gap. Among the tips: </p>
<p>
     -- On the website GetUsPPE, started by a group of doctors and supported by a volunteer team of developers, designers and organizers, more than 1,500 requests for donations have been made by health-care workers across the country seeking things like N95 respirator masks, surgical masks, hand sanitizer, face shields and protective gowns. </p>
<p>
     -- Hospitals have set up ways to link health-care providers with child-care assistance, and people can consider ways to support these efforts. Read more here. </p>

<p>
     What You Need to Know About the Stimulus Payments From the Government </p>
<p>
     In response to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, Congress is poised to approve an economic relief plan that includes one-time direct payments to most households. Here are the key details: </p>
<p>
     --The plan provides $1,200 for each adult and $500 for each child under 17. </p>
<p>
     --Almost any adult with a Social Security number qualifies, but the benefit disappears for individuals who make over $99,000 (or $198,000 for couples). Payments start phasing out for those with income above $75,000. </p>
<p>
     --Advance payments will be made based on 2019 tax returns, or 2018 returns if those aren&apos;t available. The final amount of the benefits will be determined based on 2020 income and settled on the 2020 tax return. </p>
<p>
     --The Internal Revenue Service could start issuing payments within three weeks. Read more here. </p>

Navigating Your Life During Coronavirus -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     How should you use a one-time government rebate if you&apos;re lucky enough to have your basic living expenses covered? Spend it now to keep the economy going or hold on to it in case things get worse? Keeping some of the payment might make individual sense. If you plan to spend it, consider putting it toward sectors and workers hit hardest by the pandemic due to lockdown orders or social distancing, including buying gift cards for restaurants or paying child-care workers at the usual frequency. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     PROTECT YOURSELF </p>
<p>
     How the Coronavirus Attacks Your Body </p>
<p>
     Researchers are still studying what happens in the body when someone gets infected with the new coronavirus. But what we know about how similar respiratory viruses work, as well as recent case reports from China and Washington state, have given scientists a basic understanding of how the disease progresses: </p>
<p>
     --The virus most commonly enters the nose through minuscule droplets from someone&apos;s mucus or saliva. It can also enter through the eyes or mouth. </p>
<p>
     --It hijacks cells and starts replicating, ultimately producing millions of viral particles that flood the body. </p>
<p>
     --Once it has attacked enough cells in the upper respiratory system, most people will start to feel symptoms. </p>
<p>
     --When the cells start moving down the respiratory system into the lungs it becomes a lower respiratory illness, which is considered more serious. </p>
<p>
     --When the lung becomes progressively more damaged, that triggers what is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Facts (and Myths) About Boosting Your Immune System </p>
<p>
     As the new coronavirus continues to spread, having an optimally functioning immune system is more important than ever. Your Health columnist Sumathi Reddy checked in with medical professionals, who say it&apos;s important not to rush to buy supplements and vitamins that promise to enhance your immune system. Instead, they say, stick with the more mundane, but proven, approaches: </p>
<p>
     -- Keep your stress levels down. The more you stress about the virus, the more likely you are to suffer from it. Try relaxing activities, such as meditation. </p>
<p>
     -- Exercise. Low- and moderate-intensity exercise naturally lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol and helps with immune-system function. But don&apos;t go overboard: Overexercise can weaken the immune system. </p>
<p>
     -- Watch your diet. Stick to a healthful, balanced diet filled with lots of colorful fruits and vegetables. Foods that can help support the microbiome include plain yogurt, garlic, onion, ginger, sauerkraut and fermented foods. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     The Best Ways to Clean Your Home... </p>
<p>
     Rarely have so many people given so much thought at one time to how much they clean their homes. We have guidelines culled from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and elsewhere on the spots in your house to focus on most and mistakes to avoid. Among them: </p>
<p>
     -- Make your own disinfectant wipes. You don&apos;t need to rely just on store-bought disinfectant wipes. For a homemade disinfectant, the CDC recommends mixing a quarter-cup of household chlorine bleach with one gallon of cool water. </p>
<p>
     -- In the laundry room. For laundry, use detergent and bleach (for white loads) or peroxide or color-safe bleach (for colors) to kill germs. </p>
<p>
     -- Don&apos;t overuse your strong cleaners. &quot;There is no need to panic-clean, &quot; one expert says. Just read the labels on everyday products to clean and disinfect the right way. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     ...and Your Phone </p>
<p>
     How high a priority should regular cleaning of your cellphone be? Three leading experts on microbiology and infectious disease who spoke with our tech columnist, Joanna Stern, say they don&apos;t do it often. Still, coronavirus can live on your phone. Stern has some basic lessons for what you can do -- and not do -- with that petri dish we all carry around. </p>
<p>
     -- Don&apos;t clean compulsively under normal circumstances. &quot;We don&apos;t need to be obsessively washing our phones right now. If people are coming into contact with coronavirus patients, then, yes. Wash your phone all the time. Not because there is evidence that it will transmit via a phone but because there is no evidence that it won&apos;t,&quot; says Dr. Emma Hayhurst, a microbiologist. </p>
<p>
     -- Use a strong enough disinfectant. To effectively kill the virus on a surface, you need disinfectant solution -- for instance, something with at least 55% isopropyl alcohol. Apple and Samsung have recently endorsed this technique. </p>
<p>
     -- Mind the ports. When cleaning with your disinfecting wipes, avoid getting liquid in the ports. Even if most phones are now water resistant, that resistance wears over time. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Stock Up Without Getting Fleeced </p>
<p>
     Panicked because the Purell&apos;s out? Remain calm, and heed these tips from Personal Tech columnist Nicole Nguyen. Remember: Products will eventually be back on shelves, soap can be more effective than hand sanitizer, and shipping costs sometimes exceed the price of a product, so watch out. One piece of advice: Instacart can show up-to-date information on what&apos;s in stock when other sources prove less reliable. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     What Will Coronavirus Testing and Treatment Cost Me? </p>
<p>
     In most cases, testing for the new coronavirus will not come with out-of-pocket costs. But there are some gaps. Here, we answer questions about expenses, insurance coverage and unexpected bills. </p>
<p>
     --Testing is (mostly) free. New legislation will force health insurers and employers to cover lab tests for the new coronavirus and visits to health-care providers for screening. However, if a doctor does procedures or tests to rule out the virus and ends up not ordering a lab test for it, then you might still be on the hook for your copay or deductible. </p>
<p>
     --Treatment is not. The new legislation does not guarantee that your health insurer will cover your treatment free of cost. For that, your typical plan rules will likely apply. </p>
<p>
     --Watch out for surprise bills. You could get charged for seeking treatment at hospitals, doctors or labs that aren&apos;t in your insurer&apos;s network, as well as from out-of-network specialists who see you while you&apos;re in the hospital. Read more here. </p>

     The Ins and Outs of Booking Cheap Flights and Hotels </p>
<p>
     Don&apos;t be dumb and dangerous by traveling during a pandemic just because you find a bargain-basement airfare, writes Middle Seat columnist Scott McCartney. </p>
<p>
     --Domestic trips. Later in the year, ultracheap domestic deals are worth the gamble. </p>
<p>
     --International trips. You&apos;ll want to wait longer because there is so much uncertainty in the airline and hotel industries -- unless you&apos;re after that impossible-to-get luxury hotel, safari or small-ship expedition for a trip in the fall or later. Read more here. </p>

     WORK SMARTER </p>
<p>
     Your Employment Questions, Answered: Updates </p>
<p>
     Uncertainties and anxieties about work are changing as fast as the Covid-19 outbreak appears to be spreading. Last week, we answered readers&apos; employment questions. This week, we took more readers&apos; queries to a panel of employment lawyers and human-resources experts. Here&apos;s some of what they had to say: </p>
<p>
     -- Workplace safety. Worried you could be exposed to the virus on the job? Federal and state laws require employers to provide a safe workplace, likely including providing protective equipment. But it&apos;s unlikely that employers would be required to provide N95 respirator masks, for example, and the CDC does not recommend people wear regular surgical masks unless they are sick and need to be in public. </p>
<p>
     --Turning down work. Can you turn down tasks that you fear put you at risk of infection? &quot;If an employer asks someone to put themselves at unreasonable risk, it is probably illegal,&quot; one attorney said. &quot;But if there are ways to do the work that minimize the risk of exposure, then an employer would be within their rights to fire someone who refuses.&quot; </p>
<p>
     --Caring for children and sick family members. A new law temporarily expands protections under the Family Medical Leave Act. Employers with fewer than 500 employees are required until the end of the year to provide up to two weeks of paid leave and 10 weeks at two-thirds of pay for workers. Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees may be exempt. If your employer doesn&apos;t fall under the law, check to see whether your state has expanded unemployment insurance benefits; you may qualify for help even if you haven&apos;t lost your job. Read more here and here. </p>
<p>
     Tech Tips to Work From Home: Updates </p>
<p>
     Slow Wi-Fi? Incessant notifications? Slack taking over your life? You&apos;re not alone. Personal Tech columnist Joanna Stern provides solutions to readers&apos; tech problems, with new tips every day. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     The Joy -- and Exhaustion -- of Nonstop Video Chatting: a Guide </p>
<p>
     While social distancing, we can&apos;t walk up to a colleague&apos;s desk, go out with friends, attend an exercise class, or take the kids to school. Instead, we log on to Zoom, FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp or Hangouts. Personal Tech columnist Nicole Nguyen offers advice for making the best of video calls. Plus, how to create a professional backdrop for appearing on-screen. (Hint: The background color of the wall behind you should contrast the colors of your attire, and furniture, draperies, rugs or other soft surfaces help minimize echoing when you speak.) </p>
<p>
     KEEP BOREDOM AT BAY </p>
<p>
     What to Watch Now: Updates </p>
<p>
     As new and existing streaming services overwhelm viewers with choices, The Wall Street Journal is distilling the most compelling series, movies, documentaries and live events to watch at home. Each week, we&apos;ll identify a trend in streaming entertainment, and recommend releases based on a rotating series of sources. </p>

Navigating Your Life During Coronavirus -3-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     This week focuses on live streamed performances like the one that DJ D-Nice hosted on Instagram for over 100,000 fellow users. Drake, Rihanna, Mark Zuckerberg and Joe Biden virtually dropped in. Musicians John Legend and Willie Nelson are also among those who have put on live streaming performances, and name comedians like Mike Birbiglia are also getting in on the act, often for charity. </p>
<p>
     --How do you know when a streaming show like that will drop? Publications covering entertainment sectors, such as Billboard and JamBase for the concert industry, are keeping schedules of daily live streams. To stay abreast of a specific performer, organization or venue, the best advice is to visit their social media accounts and sign up for alerts. </p>
<p>
     --Don&apos;t miss: The WSJ&apos;s four picks to add to your queue, including the third season of the crime drama &quot;Ozark&quot; on Netflix. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     MAKE THE BEST OF FAMILY TIME </p>
<p>
     The Kids Are Home. You Need to Work. Here&apos;s Help. </p>
<p>
     How can parents keep working and children keep learning while they&apos;re on top of each other? We talked to pediatricians, educators and child psychologists to get their advice. Children need some sort of schedule, but it doesn&apos;t have to look like a typical school day. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     --Screen time. Family &amp; Tech columnist Julie Jargon offers tech solutions for bored kids and recommendations for documentaries, animated titles, online games and other digital offerings to help working parents navigate the coming weeks. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     --Helping children cope. Kids can feel setbacks such as school closings and canceled sports seasons more intensely than adults because they don&apos;t have the life experience to put these events in perspective. Empathy is key. Try sharing lessons of resilience from your own life, give your children something to look forward to without painting too rosy a picture, and allow them to help shoulder some age-appropriate tasks. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     --College kids at home. Now that many college campuses have temporarily closed, families are juggling conflicting schedules and tight spaces as students return home. Some ideas: hold nightly dinners by candlelight, set schedules for shared spaces and collaborate on meal plans in Google docs. We also have advice on how to suspend payments on student loans.

Press Release: Grant &amp; Eisenhofer Announces Filing of New Shareholder Securities Action Against Kraft Heinz</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Grant &amp; Eisenhofer Announces Filing of New Shareholder Securities Action Against Kraft Heinz </p>
<p>
  PR Newswire </p>
<p>
  NEW YORK, March 28, 2020 </p>
<p>
  NEW YORK, March 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading investor law firm Grant &amp; Eisenhofer, P.A. filed a securities class action on March 25 on behalf of City of Hollywood Police Officers&apos; Retirement System against Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), certain of its current and former senior executives, and 3G Capital, Inc. and its related affiliates. </p>
<p>
  The action, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, is brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased or acquired publicly traded KHC securities, including KHC common stock, during the period between July 2, 2015 and November 4, 2015, including those who acquired KHC securities as a result of the acquisition of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (&quot;Kraft&quot;)  by the H.J. Heinz Company (&quot;Heinz&quot;). </p>
<p>
  The action is captioned City of Hollywood Police Officers&apos; Retirement System v. The Kraft Heinz Company, et al., 1:20-cv-01970 (N.D. Ill.). It is related to the consolidated action Union Asset Management Holding AG and Sjunde AP-Fonden. v. The Kraft Heinz Company, et al., 1:19-cv-01339-RMD (N.D. Ill.). </p>
<p>
  This action seeks damages for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  Defendants are The Kraft Heinz Company, 3G Capital Partners, 3G Capital, Inc., 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P., 3G Global Food Holdings GP LP, 3G Capital Partners LP, 3G Capital Partners II LP, 3G Capital Partners Ltd., Bernardo Hees (KHC&apos;s former CEO), Paulo Basilio (KHC&apos;s former CFO) and Alexandre Behring (KHC&apos;s former Chairman of the Board of Directors). </p>
<p>
  Kraft Heinz is a multi-national consumer goods conglomerate, which includes in its portfolio popular brands including Heinz ketchup, Oscar Mayer meats, Kraft cheese products, Maxwell House coffee and Jell-O desserts.  It was formed on July 2, 2015, when Heinz acquired Kraft (the &quot;Merger&quot;).  3G Capital Partners is a private equity firm that, owned Heinz, with other partners, prior to the Merger.  Subsequent to the Merger, 3G Capital Partners owned approximately 25% of KHC. </p>
<p>
  The action alleges that Defendants concealed material information and made false and misleading statements concerning the strategy that Defendants had for the company following the merger.  In particular, while Defendants assured investors that Kraft Heinz would focus on product innovation and brand marketing to maintain long term value and achieve growth, in fact the strategy was simply to aggressively and indiscriminately cut costs, which led a significant decline in the value of its most iconic brands.  When the truth regarding these false and misleading statements became known to the public, the price of KHC&apos;s publicly traded securities fell significantly, harming investors. </p>

Global Economic Fallout Grows as Coronavirus Cases Pass 600,000 -- 2nd Update</headline>
<text>

<p>
     *Trump Says Quarantine Would Be &apos;Enforceable&quot; </p>

<p>
     *Trump Says He May Make Decision Today </p>
<p>
     *Trump on Whether Country Will Reopen By Easter: &apos;We&apos;ll See What Happens&apos; </p>
<p>
     (Story below will update) </p>
<p>
     President Trump approved a disaster declaration for Michigan and Massachusetts on Saturday as the number of infections globally topped 600,000 and concerns grew about the financial toll of the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The two states now have the fifth- and sixth-most infections, respectively, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The disaster designation, which was also extended to the island territory of Guam, makes local governments eligible for additional federal funding. </p>
<p>
     The moves come a day after Mr. Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus plan, the largest economic relief package in history. </p>
<p>
     The highest number of U.S. cases continues to be in the state of New York, where almost 45,000 people have been infected and 519 have died from the virus as of Friday, state officials said. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York amid increased testing. The growth outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second- and third-most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000, respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections there rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>
<p>
     Overlapping travel bans and lockdowns have hammered businesses and led to millions of job losses, punctuated by a spike in U.S. unemployment claims to more than three million this week and a warning of a deep recession this year in trade bellwether Singapore. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009,&quot; Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said Friday. Rising bankruptcies and layoffs could undermine any recovery and do long-lasting damage to the world economy, she said. </p>
<p>
     With the pneumonia-causing virus spreading across the U.S. and Europe, after it was first detected in central China three months ago, governments around the world have ramped up efforts to limit people&apos;s movement and began imposing wide-ranging closures on businesses, restaurants and schools domestically in recent weeks. </p>
<p>
     Increasingly strict travel bans set up by large countries including the U.S. and China have put a dent in global commerce, complicating efforts to reignite growth. </p>
<p>
     France and Belgium on Friday extended their national lockdowns by two weeks, until mid-April. French Prime Minister &#201;douard Philippe said experts advising the government recommended the lockdown remain for at least six weeks. Russia on Friday suspended all passenger flights to and from the country. </p>
<p>
     The IMF warned that low-income countries will be hit particularly hard given a combination of a health crisis, sudden reversal of capital flows and in some cases a plunge in commodity prices. In Russia, where oil exports account for roughly one-third of government revenue, the ruble has fallen to its lowest level in four years. The IMF estimated that at least $2.5 trillion is needed to contain economic contraction for emerging markets. </p>
<p>
     The Chinese government is also wrestling with the economic blow from the SARS-like virus, first from a prolonged halt in domestic business activities and now from weaker consumer sentiment and shrinking export demand as the coronavirus engulfs Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, China&apos;s top decision-making body said the government plans to boost spending by increasing its fiscal deficit this year, as well as speed up issuance of Treasury bonds and so-called local government special-purpose bonds to support funding of infrastructure projects, as part of the stimulus measures to curtail economic impact from the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The fiscal policy needs to be more proactive, and the prudent monetary policy needs to be more flexible,&quot; said a statement from Friday&apos;s meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, chaired by President Xi Jinping. The government also called for a gradual reopening of shopping malls and markets to boost consumer spending. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 54 new infections Friday, saying all were imported from abroad, bringing the total to 81,394. </p>
<p>
     Other countries continue to tighten rules on social distancing. Iran this week closed shopping centers and banned road travel between cities, pledging to fine and impound the cars of offenders. Iranian officials have warned the population to brace for a second wave of infections. Afghanistan on Friday expanded restrictions by announcing a three-week lockdown on its capital, Kabul. Lebanon, which extended its nationwide lockdown until April 12, on Friday imposed a nighttime curfew. </p>
<p>
     In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan introduced further travel restrictions this weekend to combat the spread of the virus, which has infected 5,698 people and killed 92 in the country, according to a tally by national health authorities. Intercity bus and air traffic will be reduced to a minimum while all international flights will be suspended. </p>
<p>
     Hong Kong banned public gatherings of four or more people beginning midnight Sunday, with those violating the rules facing fines of more than $3,000 and six months in jail. Singapore said it would fine people who violate its social distancing rules up to about $7,000. </p>
<p>
     Australia said it would quarantine citizens returning from overseas in hotels for 14 days beginning midnight Saturday. </p>

Gun-Rights Activist Releases Blueprints for Digital Guns</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Brett Forrest </pre>
<p>
     A U.S. technology company made thousands of digital-gun files publicly available, including blueprints that will enable users to make plastic guns with three-dimensional printers, a scourge of gun-control advocates. </p>
<p>
     Cody Wilson, a director of the company, Defcad, has waged a multiyear legal battle against the federal government over the right to share 3-D-gun-related materials. This was the third time he has released such files, but the first time he has abided by U.S. foreign export controls online, using what he said are digital verification tools to ensure legal file downloads. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Wilson said he believed his release of the files would be &quot;impervious&quot; to legal challenge and would help normalize the distribution of such material for easy download in the future. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Wilson is offering access to the files for an annual fee of $50, characterizing his service as &quot;Netflix for 3-D guns.&quot; </p>
<p>
     His opponents quickly condemned the action, saying that he is bypassing federal gun laws, including those providing for background checks of gun buyers. Foes are also concerned about the proliferation of 3-D-printed guns, which don&apos;t have serial numbers, making it difficult for law-enforcement officers to track them should they be involved in a crime. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The biggest concern with 3-D-printed guns and the technical data for them is that they&apos;re not traceable,&quot; said Kelly Sampson, counsel at Brady: United Against Gun Violence, a gun-control group. &quot;It&apos;s a huge loophole and opportunity for people who would otherwise be unable to access firearms to be able to do so.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Federal law generally permits the manufacture of guns for personal use. </p>
<p>
     The State Department, which oversees the distribution of 3-D-gun blueprints, regardless of export intent, has the responsibility of scrutinizing Mr. Wilson&apos;s new effort. The department declined to comment. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Wilson said he is fighting the imposition of limits on personal freedoms and that he expects people to download the 3-D-gun files not necessarily to manufacture guns, but &quot;as a form of internal resistance.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;For me, this is a political battle,&quot; Mr. Wilson said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Wilson first alarmed lawmakers when his company, Defense Distributed, published 3-D-gun design files in 2012. In 2013, the State Department ordered him to take down the plans. </p>
<p>
     The Obama administration ultimately reasoned that the files could be downloaded by foreign nationals and were thus classified as exports regulated by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, a U.S. control on the export of defense and military technology. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Wilson had run afoul of laws designed to control sales for export, not those restricting domestic transactions. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Wilson engaged in a lengthy legal fight with the federal government, ultimately prevailing in 2018 when the State Department amended its policy and allowed the files to be posted, issuing Mr. Wilson a license to do so. </p>
<p>
     President Trump waded into the discussion that summer, writing on Twitter that he was &quot;looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn&apos;t seem to make much sense!&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Wilson again published the plans on his site, before a group of 19 state attorneys general brought suit against him in Seattle federal court. U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik issued an injunction ordering Mr. Wilson to take down the plans. </p>
<p>
     In his ruling, Mr. Lasnik wrote that Mr. Wilson aimed &quot;to arm every citizen outside of the government&apos;s traditional control mechanism.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Wilson said he had been waiting for a long-planned transfer of 3-D-gun oversight from ITAR to the Commerce Department to go through before reissuing the blueprints. Commerce Department oversight is in some respects more lenient than that of ITAR, as it isn&apos;t subject to congressional approval. </p>
<p>
     But when a new suit was brought in Seattle federal court last year, blocking the transfer of 3-D guns to the Commerce Department&apos;s oversight list, Mr. Wilson charted a new course. </p>
<p>
     Instead of openly publishing the plans, he said that he would now first vet people who would like to download them, ensuring that they are U.S. citizens or legal residents and that they are located within the U.S., maintaining compliance with ITAR export rules. </p>
<p>
     To achieve this, Mr. Wilson said he would employ four levels of security, including IP geolocation and proxy detection and technology developed for credit bureaus and anti-money-laundering specialists. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The internet is not an airtight, hack-proof system,&quot; Ms. Sampson said. &quot;Even some of our most secure databases are vulnerable. It&apos;s not quite living in reality to assume that you can 100% secure information that&apos;s online.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Wilson&apos;s proposed system can&apos;t prevent people who download blueprints from sharing them with others, including with those outside the U.S. &quot;I can only tell them that it&apos;s against the law to do so,&quot; Mr. Wilson said. </p>
<p>
     Nevertheless, Mr. Wilson said his approach adheres to export rules. &quot;I&apos;m a compliant part of the system,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Defcad has so far made 3,680 files available. Mr. Wilson said that the site will ultimately offer more than 25,000 files, the great majority of which will be for traditional guns and gun components. Many of those are already in the public domain. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Wilson, who lives in Austin, Texas, timed his Friday release to coincide with the anniversary of the 1836 execution of several hundred soldiers in the Texas revolution in the town of Goliad. </p>

&apos;Yep, We&apos;re Upgrading Corona.&apos; Analyst Says It&apos;s Time to Buy Maker of Corona Beer. -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Al Root </pre>
<p>
     Constellation Brands makes and distributes alcohol including Corona beer, Woodbridge wines, and Svedka vodka. Liquor is supposed to be -- in many respects -- recession proof. But Constellation Brands stock is underperforming its staples peers. That underperformance is an opportunity, according to one analyst. </p>
<p>
     SunTrust&apos;s Bill Chappell upgraded Constellation (ticker: STZ) stock to the equivalent of Buy from Hold Friday and raised his price target by 33%, to $200 from $150 a share. Shares closed the week at $145. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Yep, we&apos;re upgrading Corona,&quot; Chappell wrote in his research report. &quot;The Covid-19 related pullback has created an attractive entry point for a company with a resilient portfolio and strong [free cash flow] generation.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Regarding the pullback, Chappell is referring to overall stock market declines and not the unfortunate naming of one of the company&apos;s most popular products. &quot;No we don&apos;t believe that investors have sold the stock because they distribute Corona,&quot; added Chappell. </p>
<p>
     A now infamous survey suggested that almost 40% of American wouldn&apos;t buy Corona because of the coronavirus. It should go without saying the beer and the virus aren&apos;t related. Coronam -- the Latin word for crown -- lends its name to both things. That&apos;s as far as the connection goes. </p>
<p>
     The survey, published by PR firm 5W, suggested consumers were confused. It created quite a stir, prompting Constellation to release February sales numbers, which showed Corona beer sales rising year over year. 5W hasn&apos;t responded to many requests for survey details. </p>
<p>
     Barron&apos;s reached out to Constellation for another update about Corona sales, but a company representative said the firm was in its quiet period ahead of earnings. Constellation reports fiscal fourth-quarter numbers on April 3. Wall Street expects the company to earn $1.63 a share on $1.8 billion in sales. Investors can bet there will be a discussion about Corona on the earnings conference call. </p>
<p>
     Chappell, for his part, doesn&apos;t focus on Corona beer in his report. Instead he focuses on debt, noting that Constellation has above average leverage. That may have hit shares in 2020 as the market fell. Companies with more debt are often seen as riskier by investors in times of turmoil. But Chappell thinks Constellation has plenty of free cash flow to deal with its expenses. </p>
<p>
     Constellation, for reference, has about $13 billion in net debt. It generated about $1.5 billion in free cash flow over the past year. Free cash flow is the cash left over after paying all expenses, including interest and capital expenditures. </p>
<p>
     Chappell sees free cash flow growing to $2 billion as capital spending falls. Constellation has been spending money in recent years to improve its beer operations. </p>
<p>
     Chappell isn&apos;t alone in his positive views. About 75% of analysts covering the company rate Constellation shares at Buy or the equivalent, better than the 55% average buy-rating ratio for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The average Wall Street price target is about $194 a share, just below Chappell&apos;s target. </p>
<p>
     The positivity hasn&apos;t translated into returns yet. Constellation Brands stock is down 23% year to date, even after rising 21% in the past week. That&apos;s a little worse than the 21% decline of the S&amp;P 500 and a little better than the 24% decline for the Dow. </p>
<p>
     Staples firms in the S&amp;P -- including Coca-Cola (KO) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- are down 15% year to date after rising 6.5% over the past week. </p>
<p>
     Before Covid-19 fears picked up, Constellation&apos;s stock traded for roughly 22 times estimated 2020 earnings. That was a premium to the 18 times multiple for the broader stock market but roughly in line with other consumer staples firms, which traded for about 21 times earnings on average. </p>
<p>
     Today, Constellation Brands stock trades for less than 17 times earnings, close to the lowest level at any point over the past five years. Other staples firms now trade at about 18 times earnings. </p>
<p>
     On a relative basis, Constellation stock is about as attractive as it gets. </p>

Priests, Rabbis, Imams Wrestle With Coronavirus Constraints</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Francis X. Rocca in Rome and James Marson in Brussels </pre>
<p>
     At mosques around the world, the muezzins who ordinarily call Muslims to prayer five times a day are enjoining the faithful to pray at home, for the first time since Islam&apos;s Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century. </p>
<p>
     Orthodox Jews in Israel, forbidden under quarantine from going to their synagogues, are stepping out onto their balconies and porches to assemble for communal prayer. </p>
<p>
     Catholic priests in Maryland have been hearing drive-through confessions, offering forgiveness of sins to penitents who remain seated in their cars, a safe social distance away. </p>
<p>
     Ministers and ordinary believers of different faiths are adapting their practices to combat the coronavirus pandemic, in some cases going to the limits of what tradition and teaching allow. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I know of no other historical circumstance where anything like this has happened on a national, let alone global, level, as we know more about the way germs spread than before,&quot; said George Demacopoulos, co-founding director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University. </p>
<p>
     Yet adaptation to epidemics and other emergencies is nothing new in the history of religion. </p>
<p>
     During an outbreak of plague in the 16th century, the Catholic archbishop of Milan ordered altars set up around the city for the celebration of outdoor Masses that the faithful could follow from their windows. </p>
<p>
     That was a low-tech forerunner of the live-streamed liturgies -- including the Masses now celebrated every morning by Pope Francis -- that have taken the place of much public worship during the current crisis. </p>
<p>
     Anticontagion lockdowns have led religious and civil leaders in many countries to curtail public worship. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, the foremost leader in Orthodoxy, has called for an end to public church services until at least the end of March. </p>
<p>
     After leaders of the Greek Orthodox Church stated that it was impossible to become infected with the coronavirus when receiving the Eucharist, which in the Orthodox churches is administered to each communicant using a spoon, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stressed that the prohibition on public gatherings included worship, saying: &quot;I have to listen to the scientists. What applies to public gatherings, also applies to our churches.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Sheikh Raed Bader, an authority on Islamic law based in Kafr Qasim, Israel, called for the closing of all mosques earlier this month. He said the idea, unprecedented in the history of Islam, drew strong resistance at first. &quot;People were simply in shock, they were crying, they couldn&apos;t absorb the magnitude of it,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     By now, Sheikh Bader said, the closings have been accepted throughout Sunni Islam, which accounts for more than 80% of the world&apos;s 1.8 billion Muslims. </p>
<p>
     Leaders of the minority Shia branch of Islam are still debating the question, although Shia authorities in Iran last week ordered four religious sites closed, including the shrine at Qom, a city that Iranian authorities have identified as the source of the nation&apos;s Covid-19 epidemic. Pilgrims often kiss and lick shrines in Iran in the belief they can cure diseases. </p>
<p>
     Certain traditional practices have been modified or suspended in the interests of hygiene. </p>
<p>
     The Russian Orthodox Church hasn&apos;t canceled public services, but it has instituted stricter rules. Priests must now place the cross on the head of parishioners rather than allowing them to kiss it, and they are no longer supposed to let their flocks kiss their hands. Icons, the church has said, should be wiped with disinfectant after each kiss. </p>
<p>
     Rabbis in Israel and the U.S. have told Jews not to kiss the mezuzot, or scrolls bearing Bible verses, that hang on the doorposts of some homes. </p>
<p>
     Especially sacred practices have been modified in subtle ways, in order to reconcile theological strictures with the demands of hygiene. </p>
<p>
     Some Eastern Orthodox churches are getting around the sticky argument of the Eucharist by replacing the shared spoon. The Orthodox Church of Finland proposed using single-use wooden spoons, which may be burned afterward, as a blessed object can&apos;t simply be thrown in the garbage. The Romanian Orthodox Church suggested that worshipers bring their own spoons. </p>
<p>
     But innovation can be controversial. </p>
<p>
     Rabbi Daniel Roth was able to say the kaddish mourning prayer on the anniversary of his father&apos;s death last week with the help of neighbors in West Jerusalem, who stood out on their balconies and porches to assemble the quorum of 10 men, called a minyan, required by Jewish law for recitation of the prayer. </p>
<p>
     Rabbi Roth learned only afterward that the practice is controversial among Jewish scholars, some of whom argue that all participants must be on the same side of the street. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Corona is testing what a religious community means and can do at a time when everyone is required to be alone,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Leaders in the Conservative tradition of Judaism have said that a minyan can be assembled virtually, via Zoom or the like. But most Orthodox Jewish authorities would reject such a suggestion, said Rabbi David Rosen of the American Jewish Committee. </p>
<p>
     Likewise, Sheik Bader said that online assemblies can&apos;t count as communal worship, which Islam holds as much more valuable than solitary prayer. &quot;To pray together, we must do so in a straight line,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     The Catholic and Orthodox Churches have embraced virtual worship more than ever before. But administration of the sacraments, central elements of religious life for believers in both traditions, still normally requires the physical presence of minister and recipient. </p>
<p>
     The Rev. Giorgio Giovanelli, an expert in church law at Rome&apos;s Pontifical Lateran University, told Catholic News Service earlier this month that a priest might be able to hear confessions via phone or video call under extreme circumstances, though the pope would have to explicitly allow it. </p>
<p>
     But on Friday, Archbishop Leonard Blair of Hartford, Conn., chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops&apos; liturgy committee, wrote to all U.S. bishops to tell them that the Vatican had informed him that &quot;it is clear that the Sacrament is not to be celebrated via cell phone&quot; and &quot;cell phones should not be used even for the amplification of voices between a confessor and penitent who are in visual range of each other.&quot; </p>

Press Release: Herman Miller Update On Managing The Business Through The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Herman Miller Update On Managing The Business Through The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic </p>
<p>
  PR Newswire </p>
<p>
  ZEELAND, Mich., March 28, 2020 </p>
<p>
  ZEELAND, Mich., March 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Herman Miller, Inc. (NASDAQ: MLHR) is providing an update on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected its business and operations, and how the company has been developing proactive strategies to manage through this challenging time. </p>
<p>
  &quot;Herman Miller is taking significant steps to keep our employees safe and healthy while ensuring a return to form as a thriving company once this global health crisis has passed. Our strong capital position is an important foundation for our efforts to navigate the path ahead. We are grateful to all our employees for their dedication, and we will continue to respond to this dynamic situation with the health of both our employees and our company top-of-mind,&quot; said Andi Owen, President and CEO of Herman Miller. </p>
<p>
  Employee Safety and Health </p>
<p>
  While Herman Miller&apos;s manufacturing plant in Dongguan, China, experienced the initial impact of COVID-19, it is now back up and running near full capacity. Lessons learned from that first interaction with the virus led to a number of employee safety measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including domestic and international travel restrictions, work-from-home practices, extensive cleaning protocols, and ultimately the closure of our showrooms and retail outlets to the public. </p>
<p>
  Customer Focus </p>
<p>
  Our customer service, sales, supplier, and dealer teams are working closely with customers to meet current and shifting project demand.  Sales teams are meeting with customers remotely via video calls and by leveraging virtual reality to continue the design and specification process that would normally take place in a showroom. Customer service representatives are working remotely to stay connected to customers regarding order status and projected delivery dates. </p>
<p>
  Manufacturing and Operations </p>
<p>
  As a global manufacturer, Herman Miller is responding to shelter-in-place and similar government orders in various locations around the world. </p>
<p>
  In Michigan for example, Governor Gretchen Whitmer&apos;s &quot;Stay Home, Stay Safe&quot; executive order required all non-essential businesses to close for three weeks until April 13. As Herman Miller serves the health care industry and the federal government, among other critical sectors, the Company anticipates bringing back approximately as much as 30% of its manufacturing employees by next Monday, March 30 to help support customers who are actively engaged in the COVID-19 response. In an effort to support the thousands of medical workers on the front lines of the battle against COVID-19, this work will also include transforming a portion of its manufacturing footprint to fulfill the immediate need for medical and personal protective equipment.  We continue to monitor similar executive orders to understand the potential impact on our operations in other areas. </p>
<p>
  Elsewhere in the U.S., Nemschoff, which also serves the health care industry, continues operations at full capacity in Sheboygan, WI.  Distribution operations at Maharam, based in Yaphank, NY and Geiger, in both its Fulton, GA and Hildebran, NC locations, also remain open. </p>
<p>
  Internationally, outside of China, Herman Miller&apos;s manufacturing facility located near Bangalore, India is temporarily closed until April 14 under a government order. In the United Kingdom, manufacturing and distribution operations at the company&apos;s Portal Mill facility in Melksham, England are suspended until further notice due to a government-issued nationwide lockdown. In Brazil, the company&apos;s manufacturing and warehouse facilities, which serve the Latin America region, are running as normal. </p>
<p>
  Retail Operations </p>
<p>
  Design within Reach (DWR) and HAY retail studios and stores across the US are currently closed to the public, but the company&apos;s distribution center in Batavia, OH is still operational. Freight carriers are delivering to every market domestically but changing policies and procedures daily that may affect distribution. In some markets we are unable to offer white glove delivery at this time, but we can coordinate with the customers to deliver product to their door. Despite the studios and stores being closed, its eCommerce platforms are operating, and many account executives are working from home to help meet customers&apos; needs via digital chat and video capabilities, email and phone. Across those platforms, demand for home office products is helping to ease the transition of office workers who have been forced to work from home and digital marketing strategies have pivoted to highlight our ability to address that customer need. </p>
<p>
  Capital Position </p>
<p>
  In addition to steps taken to protect its workforce and manage business operations, the company has taken actions to safeguard its capital position. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the company had a well-positioned balance sheet and liquidity profile to weather these temporary disruptions, with $111 million in cash on hand, a leverage ratio of 0.9x and availability on its revolving credit facility of $266 million. Since the end of the quarter, the company withdrew $265 million on its revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to provide additional near-term liquidity. The company is also closely managing spending levels, capital investments, and working capital, and has temporarily suspended share repurchase activity as part of managing cash flows during this period. </p>
<p>
  While the longer-term economic impact cannot be reasonably estimated as the duration of this disruption is unclear, the Company is taking important steps to maintains its financial strength in the current environment. </p>
<p>

Trump Considers Coronavirus Quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jimmy Vielkind and Stella Yifan Xie </pre>
<p>
     President Trump said he is considering an &quot;enforceable quarantine&quot; in New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut and may make a decision as soon as later Saturday, as the nation&apos;s largest city quickly becomes an epicenter for the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We might not have to do it, but there&apos;s a possibility that sometime today we&apos;ll do a quarantine,&quot; Mr. Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington just before he boarded Air Force One for Norfolk, Va., where he plans to see off a Navy hospital ship that is heading to New York. He said the quarantine could last around two weeks. </p>
<p>
     The president didn&apos;t specify what a quarantine would entail, but said it could include restrictions on travel from New York and New Jersey. New York City alone has more than 23,000 cases, nearly a quarter of all the cases in the country. </p>
<p>
     The largest number of cases continues to be in the state of New York, where 52,318 people are infected and 728 had died from the virus as of Saturday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a morning briefing. </p>
<p>
     The Democratic governor said he did not speak with Mr. Trump about a quarantine, but rather the pending arrival of the USNS Comfort, the hospital ship. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I haven&apos;t had those conversations. I don&apos;t even know what that means,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said at a Saturday press briefing. &quot;I don&apos;t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don&apos;t know what you would be accomplishing.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo has already ordered all nonessential businesses in the state to close and has said residents should stay home, calling it the &quot;most drastic action we can take&quot; when he announced the measures last week. </p>
<p>
     Essential services like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies remain open under the order, and residents can still go outside for exercise and to obtain groceries. </p>
<p>
     As the case number in New York rises, concerns have mounted in other parts of the country about people leaving the state and possibly spreading coronavirus. Earlier this week, administration officials urged anyone leaving New York to self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Monday directing travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to self-isolate for that period, and said violations of the order would amount to a criminal offense. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo on Thursday issued a similar order. Mr. Trump said on Saturday he had spoken to Mr. DeSantis. </p>
<p>
     New York will move its presidential primary from April 28 to June 23, Mr. Cuomo said. Officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have all postponed balloting from April 28 to June 2. Mr. Cuomo said voting on June 23 would match New York&apos;s previously scheduled primary elections for the U.S. House of Representatives and the state legislature. </p>
<p>
     Also on Saturday, Mr. Trump approved a disaster declaration for Michigan and Massachusetts on Saturday as the number of infections globally topped 600,000 and concerns grew about the financial toll of the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The two states now have the fifth- and sixth-most infections, respectively, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The disaster designation, which was also extended to the island territory of Guam, makes local governments eligible for additional federal funding. </p>
<p>
     The moves come a day after Mr. Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus plan, the largest economic relief package in history. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York amid increased testing. The growth outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second- and third-most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000, respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections there rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>
<p>
     Overlapping travel bans and lockdowns have hammered businesses and led to millions of job losses, punctuated by a spike in U.S. unemployment claims to more than three million this week and a warning of a deep recession this year in trade bellwether Singapore. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009,&quot; Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said Friday. Rising bankruptcies and layoffs could undermine any recovery and do long-lasting damage to the world economy, she said. </p>
<p>
     With the pneumonia-causing virus spreading across the U.S. and Europe, after it was first detected in central China three months ago, governments around the world have ramped up efforts to limit people&apos;s movement and began imposing wide-ranging closures on businesses, restaurants and schools domestically in recent weeks. </p>
<p>
     Increasingly strict travel bans set up by large countries including the U.S. and China have put a dent in global commerce, complicating efforts to reignite growth. </p>
<p>
     France and Belgium on Friday extended their national lockdowns by two weeks, until mid-April. French Prime Minister &#201;douard Philippe said experts advising the government recommended the lockdown remain for at least six weeks. Russia on Friday suspended all passenger flights to and from the country. </p>
<p>
     The Chinese government is also wrestling with the economic blow from the SARS-like virus, first from a prolonged halt in domestic business activities and now from weaker consumer sentiment and shrinking export demand as the coronavirus engulfs Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, China&apos;s top decision-making body said the government plans to boost spending by increasing its fiscal deficit this year, as well as speed up issuance of Treasury bonds and so-called local government special-purpose bonds to support funding of infrastructure projects, as part of the stimulus measures to curtail economic impact from the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 54 new infections Friday, saying all were imported from abroad, bringing the total to 81,394. </p>
<p>
     Other countries continue to tighten rules on social distancing. Iran this week closed shopping centers and banned road travel between cities, pledging to fine and impound the cars of offenders. Iranian officials have warned the population to brace for a second wave of infections. Afghanistan on Friday expanded restrictions by announcing a three-week lockdown on its capital, Kabul. Lebanon, which extended its nationwide lockdown until April 12, on Friday imposed a nighttime curfew. </p>

Coronavirus Pandemic Has Army Paying Recruits Even Before Boot Camp</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Michael M. Phillips, Ben Kesling and Michael R. Gordon </pre>
<p>
     The Army is planning to put some new enlistees on the payroll even before they ship out for boot camp, an unusual stopgap to maintain recruiting amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Contagion fears have disrupted the Army&apos;s schedule for shipping recruits to basic training, stranding some volunteers who have already quit civilian jobs and given up apartment leases in anticipation of beginning their military service. </p>
<p>
     To protect those who face such a predicament, the Army plans to pay those in need of a private&apos;s salary -- $1,604 a month -- to stay home until health concerns subside and the service is in a position to accept the recruits. The Army is even considering a bonus payment to be awarded when the recruit finally leaves for boot camp. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s the right thing to do -- these people quit their jobs,&quot; Maj. Gen. Frank Muth, head of Army Recruiting Command, told The Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>
     Gen. Muth said the move is unprecedented for the Army and predicted that hundreds of recruits could qualify for early salaries, depending on the course of the disease. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re getting the authorities in place,&quot; said Gen. Muth. &quot;So we&apos;re looking at getting this going&quot; over the coming week. </p>
<p>
     Across the armed forces, the virus has led the services to think of ways to maintain the flow of new recruits, maintain training and keep up its force strength. </p>
<p>
     The Army is planning to recall some former soldiers to duty under new authority granted by President Trump, a defense official said Saturday. Mr. Trump signed an executive order Friday authorizing the Army and other services to call up reservists to active duty as needed, including those on individual ready reserve. The category includes troops who have left the service and no longer drill or train. </p>
<p>
     This marks only the fourth time the authorization has been used since World War II, according to the Pentagon. </p>
<p>
     Like other services, Marine Corps recruiters have suspended in-person interviews and are conducting their recruiting efforts by phone and social media. And once Marines arrive for basic training, they are being isolated for a period to ensure they don&apos;t have symptoms of the virus. </p>
<p>
     &quot;When you get to Parris Island or San Diego, you&apos;re in isolation for a period so we can observe and make sure everybody is healthy from Day One, &quot; Gen. David Berger, the Marine Corps commandant, told Pentagon reporters on Thursday. </p>
<p>
     Faced with possible personnel shortages, the Navy announced this week that it is offering incentives to sailors at sea and in other key jobs to extend their enlistments six to 12 months past impending discharge dates. The incentives include extra pay of $400 to $1,000 a month. The Navy also invited recently separated sailors to rejoin the service. </p>
<p>
     The effort &quot;will provide stability to both the Navy and our families,&quot; Vice Adm. John B. Nowell, the service&apos;s top uniformed personnel officer, said in an announcement. </p>
<p>
     For the Army, signing up soldiers is a time-consuming and labor-intensive job at the best of times as recruiters pitch military service to high-schoolers and their parents, gather paperwork and ensure potential soldiers stay on track until they leave for boot camp. </p>
<p>
     Soaring unemployment caused by the coronavirus crisis may make recruiting easier for the Army in the year ahead. &quot;We&apos;ve found when unemployment is above 6%, there is a balance of less competition from the civilian labor market and applicants who are more open to considering the Army for a career,&quot; an Army Recruiting Command spokeswoman said. </p>
<p>
     But the main effect of the health crisis so far has been to fuel worry within the military that would-be recruits may be less eager to join an institution in which social distancing isn&apos;t always practical and that the induction of those who have already put their hands up may be delayed. </p>
<p>
     The Army, which has 1,400 recruiting stations, has stopped dispatching recruits from some cities -- such as San Francisco and New York -- that have imposed stay-at-home orders or shuttered business as the virus has spread, a list that is likely to grow. </p>
<p>
     The week of March 23, the Army had planned to ship 1,200 recruits to basic training, but only 1,000 were sent due to the health crisis. Gen. Muth said the Army expects the flow of recruits to be cut by 50% in the weeks ahead. </p>
<p>
     To sustain its recruiting efforts, recruits who had signed enlistment contracts with March or April boot-camp departures in cities that are virus hot spots are now being offered fresh contracts with start dates one or even six months out. </p>
<p>
     Army recruiters, who often become intimately familiar with the lives of those they sign up, are sifting through the pool of recruits to see which ones have been left financially distressed by the boot-camp delay. The first payments, Gen. Muth said, could begin as early as the coming week. As the recruits wait to leave for boot camp, they might be assigned some minor online tasks, such as learning the Army rank structure, he added. </p>

Trump Considers Coronavirus Quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus, Jimmy Vielkind and Stella Yifan Xie </pre>
<p>
     President Trump said he is considering an &quot;enforceable quarantine&quot; in New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut and may make a decision as soon as later Saturday, as the nation&apos;s largest city quickly becomes an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We might not have to do it, but there&apos;s a possibility that sometime today we&apos;ll do a quarantine,&quot; Mr. Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington just before he boarded Air Force One for Norfolk, Va., where he plans to see off a Navy hospital ship that is heading to New York. He said the quarantine could last around two weeks. </p>
<p>
     The president didn&apos;t specify what a quarantine would entail, but said it could include restrictions on travel from New York and New Jersey. New York City alone has more than 23,000 cases, nearly a quarter of all the cases in the country. </p>
<p>
     The largest number of cases continues to be in the state of New York, where 52,318 people are infected and 728 had died from the virus as of Saturday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a morning briefing. </p>
<p>
     The Democratic governor said he didn&apos;t speak with Mr. Trump about a quarantine, but rather the pending arrival of the USNS Comfort, the hospital ship. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I haven&apos;t had those conversations. I don&apos;t even know what that means,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said at a Saturday press briefing. &quot;I don&apos;t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don&apos;t know what you would be accomplishing.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo has already ordered all nonessential businesses in the state to close and has said residents should stay home, calling it the &quot;most drastic action we can take&quot; when he announced the measures last week. </p>
<p>
     Essential services like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies remain open under the order, and residents can still go outside for exercise and to obtain groceries. </p>
<p>
     As the case number in New York rises, concerns have mounted in other parts of the country about people leaving the state and possibly spreading coronavirus. Earlier this week, administration officials urged anyone leaving New York to self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Monday directing travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to self-isolate for that period, and said violations of the order would amount to a criminal offense. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo on Thursday issued a similar order. Mr. Trump said on Saturday he had spoken to Mr. DeSantis. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They&apos;re having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers going down,&quot; Mr. Trump said. </p>
<p>
     New York will move its presidential primary from April 28 to June 23, Mr. Cuomo said. </p>
<p>
     Officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have all postponed balloting from April 28 to June 2. Mr. Cuomo said voting on June 23 would match New York&apos;s previously scheduled primary elections for the U.S. House of Representatives and the state legislature. </p>
<p>
     Also on Saturday, Mr. Trump approved a disaster declaration for Michigan and Massachusetts as the number of infections globally topped 600,000 and concerns grew about the financial toll. </p>
<p>
     The two states now have the fifth- and sixth-most infections in the U.S., respectively, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The disaster designation, which was also extended to the island territory of Guam, makes local governments eligible for additional federal funding. </p>
<p>
     The moves come a day after Mr. Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus plan, the largest economic relief package in history. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York amid increased testing. </p>
<p>
     The growth outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second- and third-most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000, respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections there rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>
<p>
     Overlapping travel bans and lockdowns have hammered businesses and led to millions of job losses, punctuated by a spike in U.S. unemployment claims to more than three million this week and a warning of a deep recession this year in trade bellwether Singapore. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009,&quot; Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said Friday. Rising bankruptcies and layoffs could undermine any recovery and do long-lasting damage to the world economy, she said. </p>
<p>
     With the pneumonia-causing virus spreading across the U.S. and Europe, after it was first detected in central China three months ago, governments around the world have ramped up efforts to limit people&apos;s movement and began imposing wide-ranging closures on businesses, restaurants and schools domestically in recent weeks. </p>
<p>
     Increasingly strict travel bans set up by large countries including the U.S. and China have put a dent in global commerce, complicating efforts to reignite growth. </p>
<p>
     France and Belgium on Friday extended their national lockdowns by two weeks, until mid-April. French Prime Minister &#201;douard Philippe said experts advising the government recommended the lockdown remain for at least six weeks. Russia on Friday suspended all passenger flights to and from the country. </p>
<p>
     The Chinese government is also wrestling with the economic blow, first from a prolonged halt in domestic business activities and now from weaker consumer sentiment and shrinking export demand as the coronavirus engulfs Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, China&apos;s top decision-making body said the government plans to boost spending by increasing its fiscal deficit this year, as well as speed up issuance of Treasury bonds and so-called local government special-purpose bonds to support funding of infrastructure projects, as part of the stimulus measures to curtail economic impact from the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     China&apos;s National Health Commission reported 54 new infections Friday, saying all were imported from abroad, bringing the total to 81,394. </p>
<p>
     Other countries continue to tighten rules on social distancing. Iran this week closed shopping centers and banned road travel between cities, pledging to fine and impound the cars of offenders. Iranian officials have warned the population to brace for a second wave of infections. Afghanistan on Friday expanded restrictions by announcing a three-week lockdown on its capital, Kabul. Lebanon, which extended its nationwide lockdown until April 12, on Friday imposed a nighttime curfew. </p>

Navigating Your Life During Coronavirus</headline>
<text>
<p>
     As the coronavirus pandemic upends work, travel and home life, the rules are shifting for what people can and can&apos;t do in their daily lives. The WSJ is continuously updating advice and information on how to stay safe, healthy and connected and how to help others. Here&apos;s our latest news, answering your questions: </p>
<p>
     STAY HEALTHY </p>
<p>
     The Risks of Visits to the Grocery Store </p>
<p>
     With communities across the country virtually shut down, there is still one place nearly everyone needs to visit at some point: the grocery store. Experts say deliveries are safer, but sometimes it can be hard to get one scheduled right away. So if you must go to the store, what&apos;s the best way to navigate the aisles and crowds? We asked the experts. Among their tips: </p>
<p>
     --Try to minimize visits to the store. &quot;The biggest risk factor is really being around other people,&quot; says Benjamin Chapman, a professor of food safety at North Carolina State University. </p>
<p>
     --Many grocery stores are providing shoppers with wipes. If not, it&apos;s a good idea to bring your own, mainly to wipe the grocery cart. </p>
<p>
     --Try to avoid exchanging money or credit cards with the cashier. Use a credit card reader when possible. </p>
<p>
     --People over 65 and those who have medical conditions that put them at greater risk of hospitalization and serious illness should avoid going to the grocery store, if possible. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Answers on Home Food Delivery </p>
<p>
     As the virus keeps people away from restaurants and grocery stores, more people are turning to deliveries. We&apos;e dug into what you need to know about ordering food. Among the tips: </p>
<p>
     --Ordering food is generally safer than going to a grocery store or a restaurant. </p>
<p>
     --There appears to be no risk of contracting the virus by eating it in cooked food. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     How Older Adults Can Cope During the Pandemic </p>
<p>
     With the new coronavirus targeting older adults, how can they best cope and how can their adult children help them? Brian Carpenter, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., has given those questions a lot of thought. He is a geropsychologist, which means he specializes in treating older adults. He&apos;s also the son of parents ages 77 and 78. In an edited interview, Dr. Carpenter discusses how older adults can cope during the pandemic. Here are some of the questions he answered: </p>
<p>
     How can you protect your parents without infantilizing them? </p>
<p>
     We&apos;re going to see a lot of interesting negotiations in families about who is doing what for whom and why. Having an explicit conversation about that would be helpful. Adult children may be trying to be helpful by offering support and services. Maybe that&apos;s to protect their parents. </p>
<p>
     But maybe it&apos;s also to allay their own anxiety and worry and give them a sense they are doing something helpful. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that. But they need to pause and ask, &quot;Am I doing this for my parents or for me or for both of us?&quot; Be honest about it. </p>
<p>
     What about older adults who don&apos;t have family? </p>
<p>
     This is a time when community -- large and small -- can step up to help support older adults who don&apos;t have family. The community in the apartment buildings where someone lives, or a next-door neighbor. The communities of social service organizations and institutions, who can identify a person in need. We have a student organization on our campus, a local chapter of &quot;Adopt a Grandparent,&quot; where students do volunteer work with residents at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Our students are no longer here in St. Louis, but the organization is talking with administrators to see how our students can send pictures of themselves, cards, letters and videos to stay in touch with them. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Five Home Workouts to Try </p>
<p>
     Experts say it&apos;s important to still get exercise while we&apos;re hunkered down. We found these specially designed workouts you can do at home for beginners or gym rats with different amounts of space and equipment. </p>
<p>
     Here&apos;s one instructor&apos;s advice for people stuck at home jonesing for yoga: </p>
<p>
     Simple cross-legged position </p>
<p>
     &quot;This pose teaches us to sit calmly in the entirety of the moment, even in fear,&quot; the instructor says. Place your hands on the tops of your thighs for extra grounding. </p>
<p>
     Cat-cow breath </p>
<p>
     Start on your hands and knees with your wrists directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips. On an inhale, lift your heart up to the ceiling, arching the back, coming into cow pose. On an exhale, round the spine into cat pose. </p>
<p>
     Humble warrior </p>
<p>
     Start in warrior one pose, with your right leg forward, knee bent over ankle, and left leg straight and strong behind, foot turned out to a 45-degree angle. Clasp both hands behind your lower back. As you bend your chest forward inside of your right knee, bring your arms overhead. Repeat on the opposite side. </p>
<p>
     Camel </p>
<p>
     Kneel with hips over knees and toes tucked (flat for more of a challenge). Place your hands on the small of your back and slowly drop your head and shoulders backward toward the wall. If comfortable, reach down to hold the heels of your feet. </p>
<p>
     Reclined cobbler </p>
<p>
     Lie on your back. Bend your knees, opening your thighs out to the side and bringing the soles of your feet together. Place one hand on your heart and the other hand onto your belly. Breathe here for five to seven minutes. See four other workouts here. </p>
<p>
     Answers to Your Coronavirus Health Questions: Updates </p>
<p>
     With the scale and impact of the pandemic changing daily, we&apos;re continuously answering readers&apos; health questions. Your Health columnist Sumathi Reddy tackles many more questions on how to stay healthy here. And, as the science evolves, we&apos;re updating what we know here. </p>
<p>
     Today&apos;s Q&amp;A: Should parents grappling with school closures rely on grandparents for child care? This is a tough one. Older people are at the highest risk of developing serious illness and potential complications, or dying, from Covid-19. Children, meanwhile, appear to have few and sometimes no symptoms, making it hard to know if they are even infected. There&apos;s no data yet showing that children are transmitting the virus to older people but they are a large source of infection for other respiratory viruses. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Is there anybody else that can potentially take care of the children?&quot; suggests Andrew Janowski, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Washington University School of Medicine and St. Louis Children&apos;s Hospital. </p>
<p>
     Still, he and other experts acknowledge that for many families there may be no alternative. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the division of infectious disease at Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital in Boston, says if the family is living together and no one is commuting with the potential for outside exposure, that lessens the risk. &quot;People have to figure out a way of coping and there&apos;s not going to be an ideal solution for everybody. Presumably now that kids are going to be home there&apos;s hopefully less opportunity for them to become infected,&quot; he says. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     HELP OTHERS </p>
<p>
     How to Aid Hospitals, Doctors and Nurses </p>
<p>
     The second installment of the How You Can Help column takes a look at how regular people can help fill the medical supply gap. Among the tips: </p>
<p>
     -- On the website GetUsPPE, started by a group of doctors and supported by a volunteer team of developers, designers and organizers, more than 1,500 requests for donations have been made by health-care workers across the country seeking things like N95 respirator masks, surgical masks, hand sanitizer, face shields and protective gowns. </p>
<p>
     -- Hospitals have set up ways to link health-care providers with child-care assistance, and people can consider ways to support these efforts. Read more here. </p>

     MANAGE YOUR MONEY </p>
<p>
     What You Need to Know About the Stimulus Payments From the Government </p>
<p>
     In response to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, Congress is poised to approve an economic relief plan that includes one-time direct payments to most households. Here are the key details: </p>
<p>
     --The plan provides $1,200 for each adult and $500 for each child under 17. </p>
<p>
     --Almost any adult with a Social Security number qualifies, but the benefit disappears for individuals who make over $99,000 (or $198,000 for couples). Payments start phasing out for those with income above $75,000. </p>
<p>
     --Advance payments will be made based on 2019 tax returns, or 2018 returns if those aren&apos;t available. The final amount of the benefits will be determined based on 2020 income and settled on the 2020 tax return. </p>
<p>
     --The Internal Revenue Service could start issuing payments within three weeks. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     The Best Ways to Spend Your Stimulus Money </p>
<p>
     How should you use a one-time government rebate if you&apos;re lucky enough to have your basic living expenses covered? Spend it now to keep the economy going or hold on to it in case things get worse? Keeping some of the payment might make individual sense. If you plan to spend it, consider putting it toward sectors and workers hit hardest by the pandemic due to lockdown orders or social distancing, including buying gift cards for restaurants or paying child-care workers at the usual frequency. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     PROTECT YOURSELF </p>
<p>
     How the Coronavirus Attacks Your Body </p>
<p>
     Researchers are still studying what happens in the body when someone gets infected with the new coronavirus. But what we know about how similar respiratory viruses work, as well as recent case reports from China and Washington state, have given scientists a basic understanding of how the disease progresses: </p>
<p>
     --The virus most commonly enters the nose through minuscule droplets from someone&apos;s mucus or saliva. It can also enter through the eyes or mouth. </p>
<p>
     --It hijacks cells and starts replicating, ultimately producing millions of viral particles that flood the body. </p>
<p>
     --Once it has attacked enough cells in the upper respiratory system, most people will start to feel symptoms. </p>

<p>
     --When the cells start moving down the respiratory system into the lungs it becomes a lower respiratory illness, which is considered more serious. </p>
<p>
     --When the lung becomes progressively more damaged, that triggers what is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Facts (and Myths) About Boosting Your Immune System </p>
<p>
     As the new coronavirus continues to spread, having an optimally functioning immune system is more important than ever. Your Health columnist Sumathi Reddy checked in with medical professionals, who say it&apos;s important not to rush to buy supplements and vitamins that promise to enhance your immune system. Instead, they say, stick with the more mundane, but proven, approaches: </p>
<p>
     -- Keep your stress levels down. The more you stress about the virus, the more likely you are to suffer from it. Try relaxing activities, such as meditation. </p>
<p>
     -- Exercise. Low- and moderate-intensity exercise naturally lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol and helps with immune-system function. But don&apos;t go overboard: Overexercise can weaken the immune system. </p>
<p>
     -- Watch your diet. Stick to a healthful, balanced diet filled with lots of colorful fruits and vegetables. Foods that can help support the microbiome include plain yogurt, garlic, onion, ginger, sauerkraut and fermented foods. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     The Best Ways to Clean Your Home... </p>
<p>
     Rarely have so many people given so much thought at one time to how much they clean their homes. We have guidelines culled from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and elsewhere on the spots in your house to focus on most and mistakes to avoid. Among them: </p>
<p>
     -- Make your own disinfectant wipes. You don&apos;t need to rely just on store-bought disinfectant wipes. For a homemade disinfectant, the CDC recommends mixing a quarter-cup of household chlorine bleach with one gallon of cool water. </p>
<p>
     -- In the laundry room. For laundry, use detergent and bleach (for white loads) or peroxide or color-safe bleach (for colors) to kill germs. </p>
<p>
     -- Don&apos;t overuse your strong cleaners. &quot;There is no need to panic-clean, &quot; one expert says. Just read the labels on everyday products to clean and disinfect the right way. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     ...and Your Phone </p>
<p>
     How high a priority should regular cleaning of your cellphone be? Three leading experts on microbiology and infectious disease who spoke with our tech columnist, Joanna Stern, say they don&apos;t do it often. Still, coronavirus can live on your phone. Stern has some basic lessons for what you can do -- and not do -- with that petri dish we all carry around. </p>
<p>
     -- Don&apos;t clean compulsively under normal circumstances. &quot;We don&apos;t need to be obsessively washing our phones right now. If people are coming into contact with coronavirus patients, then, yes. Wash your phone all the time. Not because there is evidence that it will transmit via a phone but because there is no evidence that it won&apos;t,&quot; says Dr. Emma Hayhurst, a microbiologist. </p>
<p>
     -- Use a strong enough disinfectant. To effectively kill the virus on a surface, you need disinfectant solution -- for instance, something with at least 55% isopropyl alcohol. Apple and Samsung have recently endorsed this technique. </p>
<p>
     -- Mind the ports. When cleaning with your disinfecting wipes, avoid getting liquid in the ports. Even if most phones are now water resistant, that resistance wears over time. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     Stock Up Without Getting Fleeced </p>
<p>
     Panicked because the Purell&apos;s out? Remain calm, and heed these tips from Personal Tech columnist Nicole Nguyen. Remember: Products will eventually be back on shelves, soap can be more effective than hand sanitizer, and shipping costs sometimes exceed the price of a product, so watch out. One piece of advice: Instacart can show up-to-date information on what&apos;s in stock when other sources prove less reliable. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     What Will Coronavirus Testing and Treatment Cost Me? </p>
<p>
     In most cases, testing for the new coronavirus will not come with out-of-pocket costs. But there are some gaps. Here, we answer questions about expenses, insurance coverage and unexpected bills. </p>
<p>
     --Testing is (mostly) free. New legislation will force health insurers and employers to cover lab tests for the new coronavirus and visits to health-care providers for screening. However, if a doctor does procedures or tests to rule out the virus and ends up not ordering a lab test for it, then you might still be on the hook for your copay or deductible. </p>
<p>
     --Treatment is not. The new legislation does not guarantee that your health insurer will cover your treatment free of cost. For that, your typical plan rules will likely apply. </p>
<p>
     --Watch out for surprise bills. You could get charged for seeking treatment at hospitals, doctors or labs that aren&apos;t in your insurer&apos;s network, as well as from out-of-network specialists who see you while you&apos;re in the hospital. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     KEEP BOREDOM AT BAY </p>
<p>
     Storytelling in the Time of Coronavirus </p>
<p>
     Award-winning author Joyce Carol Oates has this prediction about what happens to storytelling in the age of social distancing: We need stories, and we will have them. She writes: </p>
<p>
     While other activities are likely to be radically changed, the reading experience is not likely to change significantly. Bookstores may be closed to live customers but are still taking orders for wares which may be mailed for no charge or, ingeniously, even picked up at curbside; e-books and audiobooks may be downloaded from public libraries. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     For those wondering where to start, here are nine books out this spring. </p>
<p>
     What to Watch Now: Updates </p>
<p>
     As new and existing streaming services overwhelm viewers with choices, The Wall Street Journal is distilling the most compelling series, movies, documentaries and live events to watch at home. Each week, we&apos;ll identify a trend in streaming entertainment, and recommend releases based on a rotating series of sources. </p>
<p>
     This week focuses on live streamed performances like the one that DJ D-Nice hosted on Instagram for over 100,000 fellow users. Drake, Rihanna, Mark Zuckerberg and Joe Biden virtually dropped in. Musicians John Legend and Willie Nelson are also among those who have put on live streaming performances, and name comedians like Mike Birbiglia are also getting in on the act, often for charity. </p>
<p>
     --How do you know when a streaming show like that will drop? Publications covering entertainment sectors, such as Billboard and JamBase for the concert industry, are keeping schedules of daily live streams. To stay abreast of a specific performer, organization or venue, the best advice is to visit their social media accounts and sign up for alerts. </p>
<p>

     The Ins and Outs of Booking Cheap Flights and Hotels </p>
<p>
     Don&apos;t be dumb and dangerous by traveling during a pandemic just because you find a bargain-basement airfare, writes Middle Seat columnist Scott McCartney. </p>
<p>
     --Domestic trips. Later in the year, ultracheap domestic deals are worth the gamble. </p>
<p>
     --International trips. You&apos;ll want to wait longer because there is so much uncertainty in the airline and hotel industries -- unless you&apos;re after that impossible-to-get luxury hotel, safari or small-ship expedition for a trip in the fall or later. Read more here. </p>

     Your Employment Questions, Answered: Updates </p>
<p>
     Uncertainties and anxieties about work are changing as fast as the Covid-19 outbreak appears to be spreading. Last week, we answered readers&apos; employment questions. This week, we took more readers&apos; queries to a panel of employment lawyers and human-resources experts. Here&apos;s some of what they had to say: </p>
<p>
     -- Workplace safety. Worried you could be exposed to the virus on the job? Federal and state laws require employers to provide a safe workplace, likely including providing protective equipment. But it&apos;s unlikely that employers would be required to provide N95 respirator masks, for example, and the CDC does not recommend people wear regular surgical masks unless they are sick and need to be in public. </p>
<p>
     --Turning down work. Can you turn down tasks that you fear put you at risk of infection? &quot;If an employer asks someone to put themselves at unreasonable risk, it is probably illegal,&quot; one attorney said. &quot;But if there are ways to do the work that minimize the risk of exposure, then an employer would be within their rights to fire someone who refuses.&quot; </p>
<p>
     --Caring for children and sick family members. A new law temporarily expands protections under the Family Medical Leave Act. Employers with fewer than 500 employees are required until the end of the year to provide up to two weeks of paid leave and 10 weeks at two-thirds of pay for workers. Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees may be exempt. If your employer doesn&apos;t fall under the law, check to see whether your state has expanded unemployment insurance benefits; you may qualify for help even if you haven&apos;t lost your job.

Navigating Your Life During Coronavirus -3-</headline>
<text>
<p>
     While social distancing, we can&apos;t walk up to a colleague&apos;s desk, go out with friends, attend an exercise class, or take the kids to school. Instead, we log on to Zoom, FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp or Hangouts. Personal Tech columnist Nicole Nguyen offers advice for making the best of video calls. Plus, how to create a professional backdrop for appearing on-screen. (Hint: The background color of the wall behind you should contrast the colors of your attire, and furniture, draperies, rugs or other soft surfaces help minimize echoing when you speak.) </p>
<p>
     MAKE THE BEST OF FAMILY TIME </p>
<p>
     The Kids Are Home. You Need to Work. Here&apos;s Help. </p>
<p>
     How can parents keep working and children keep learning while they&apos;re on top of each other? We talked to pediatricians, educators and child psychologists to get their advice. Children need some sort of schedule, but it doesn&apos;t have to look like a typical school day. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     --Screen time. Family &amp; Tech columnist Julie Jargon offers tech solutions for bored kids and recommendations for documentaries, animated titles, online games and other digital offerings to help working parents navigate the coming weeks. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     --Helping children cope. Kids can feel setbacks such as school closings and canceled sports seasons more intensely than adults because they don&apos;t have the life experience to put these events in perspective. Empathy is key. Try sharing lessons of resilience from your own life, give your children something to look forward to without painting too rosy a picture, and allow them to help shoulder some age-appropriate tasks. Read more here. </p>
<p>
     --College kids at home. Now that many college campuses have temporarily closed, families are juggling conflicting schedules and tight spaces as students return home. Some ideas: hold nightly dinners by candlelight, set schedules for shared spaces and collaborate on meal plans in Google docs. We also have advice on how to suspend payments on student loans.

Investing in the Creative Economy is a Boon to Artists and Communities -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Karen Hube </pre>
<p>
     It all started with a pie chart. Or rather, with what wasn&apos;t on a pie chart. In 2014, Laura Callanan, while serving as senior deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, was looking at a graphic representing how much impact-investment capital was targeted to different economic sectors. There was a category for &quot;arts and culture,&quot; but because of rounding, its assets were 0%. </p>
<p>
     &quot;That made me nuts,&quot; Callanan says. &quot;The creative economy is 4.2% of the U.S. GDP and 3% of the global GDP. How can it be zero when so many investors are looking for ways to do some good?&quot; </p>
<p>
     Unlike popular causes that attracted some $500 billion in impact-investing dollars in 2018 -- such as climate change, poverty, and gender equality -- pathways to support the arts through investments aren&apos;t always obvious. Yet the positive effects are profound. Investing in the creative economy isn&apos;t just about benefiting artists. A thriving arts scene often breathes life into communities by attracting new businesses, creating jobs, and drawing traffic. </p>
<p>
     Callanan was convinced that if investors understood the power of creative capital, and had on-ramps to investments, the arts-impact slice of the pie would be significantly larger. What followed was her creation of a group called Upstart Co-Lab in 2015, a nonprofit that aims to raise the visibility and accessibility of impact investing in the arts. Its first step was to clearly define the creative economy. Far from the clich&#233; of a beret-clad artist at an easel, the definition includes 145 businesses as diverse as furniture making, nail art, apparel manufacturing, book printing, and more. </p>
<p>
     Gary Hattem, a longtime New York City resident and retired Deutsche Bank managing director, became one of the first to invest in an impact private-debt fund developed through a partnership between Upstart Co-Lab and the Local Initiatives Support Corp. (LISC), a </p>
<p>
     community-development group. In its 40-year history, LISC has raised and committed more than $60 billion in grants and investments to revitalize communities. The LISC NYC fund is its first focused on the creative economy. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I wanted to put my capital to work in a meaningful way,&quot; Hattem says. &quot;To me, it made sense that the arts is a sector that could build the local economy.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Last year, the fund exceeded its $5 million target and raised $6.2 million for three projects across New York, including a $3 million revolving line of credit </p>
<p>
     to the La Mama Experimental Theatre Club to renovate its facilities. LISC has a strong risk profile -- it has a double-A rating by Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s and has made good on more than $1.7 billion in loans since 1980. </p>
<p>
     Investing in affordable housing for artists has proven to be transformative to neighborhoods across the country. </p>
<p>
     In the early 2000s, Sam Farrazaino, a sculptor and developer in Seattle, noticed that his city was losing its artistic character -- &quot;losing its soul,&quot; he says -- as industry and developers moved in from outside. In 2006, his company, Equinox Development Unlimited, bought and renovated a World War II-era factory building in Georgetown, an industrial area of the city, to create spaces for artists to live and work. </p>
<p>
     Today the 100,000-square-foot Equinox development houses 125 tenants, and Georgetown is a vibrant center. A December holiday event in the neighborhood called The Very Open House, with sculpture installations, three marching bands, and a bonfire, drew some 8,000 visitors. </p>
<p>
     One of the best examples of how community vitality grows out of art is the impact of a Santa Fe, N.M., artist collective called Meow Wolf, says Phil Kirshman, an investor in the collective and the chief investment officer at </p>
<p>
     Cornerstone Capital Investment Management. Meow Wolf opened a 30,000-square-foot art installation in Santa Fe in 2016 and has become the biggest tourist attraction in town. It brought in 500,000 visitors last year, employs 450 artists, and is a source of funding for creative organizations. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This is an example of a creative economy entrepreneurship model,&quot; Kirshman says. &quot;Its driving force was to employ artists, and it has a high social impact.&quot; </p>

European Banks Are Asked to Suspend Dividends. Could U.S. Banks Be Asked the Same? -- Barrons.com</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Lawrence C. Strauss </pre>
<p>
     The European Central Bank is asking banks to suspend dividend payments through October to preserve lending capacity during the coronavirus crisis, a call that comes about two weeks after a group of eight big U.S. banks suspended their own stock buybacks to conserve capital. </p>
<p>
     The ECB, in a statement Friday, said the recommendation &quot;concerns dividends for 2019 and 2020, at least until&quot; October of this year. It said that its recommendation to forgo dividends was &quot;to boost banks&apos; capacity to absorb losses and support lending to households, small business and corporates&quot; during the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The European Banking Federation, an industry trade group, said Friday that banks should halt 2020 dividend payments but said 2019 payouts should be the decision of individual institutions, according to a Reuters report. </p>
<p>
     Unlike U.S. firms, many European companies don&apos;t pay dividends on a quarterly basis, sometimes paying once or twice a year. The DAX stock index, which tracks large German companies, has fallen 19% this month. The CAC 40, whose constituents include blue-chip French companies, is down 18%. </p>
<p>
     In the U.S., Bank of America (ticker: BAC), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), and six of the other largest banks suspended stock buybacks through the second quarter in an effort to support &quot;customers, clients, and the nation&quot; amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>

<p>
     Dividends are becoming rarer across the corporate world, as the coronavirus pandemic spreads. Some big U.S. firms in industries hit hard by the crisis, including Delta Air Lines (DAL), Ford Motor (F), and Marriott International (MAR), have already suspended their dividends. </p>
<p>
     Under the roughly $2 trillion stimulus package signed into law Friday, companies wouldn&apos;t be able to pay dividends until &quot;12 months after the date of the loan or loan guarantee is no longer outstanding.&quot; </p>
<p>
     But outside of companies taking advantage of stimulus funds, there has been no blanket ban on dividends, thus far. </p>
<p>
     IHS Markit said recently that it expects there will be 230 dividend suspensions from the 1,800 largest payers globally. </p>

Trump Considers Coronavirus Quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus, Jimmy Vielkind and Stella Yifan Xie </pre>
<p>
     President Trump said he is considering an &quot;enforceable quarantine&quot; in New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut and may make a decision as soon as later Saturday, as the nation&apos;s largest city quickly becomes an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We might not have to do it, but there&apos;s a possibility that sometime today we&apos;ll do a quarantine,&quot; Mr. Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington just before he boarded Air Force One for Norfolk, Va., where he plans to see off a Navy hospital ship that is heading to New York. He said the quarantine could last around two weeks. </p>
<p>
     The president didn&apos;t specify what a quarantine would entail, but said it could include restrictions on travel from New York and New Jersey. New York City alone has more than 23,000 cases, nearly a quarter of all the cases in the country. </p>
<p>
     The largest number of cases continues to be in the state of New York, where 52,318 people are infected and 728 had died from the virus as of Saturday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a morning briefing. </p>
<p>
     The Democratic governor said he didn&apos;t speak with Mr. Trump about a quarantine, but rather the pending arrival of the USNS Comfort, the hospital ship. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I haven&apos;t had those conversations. I don&apos;t even know what that means,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said at a Saturday press briefing. &quot;I don&apos;t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don&apos;t know what you would be accomplishing.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo has already ordered all nonessential businesses in the state to close and has said residents should stay home, calling it the &quot;most drastic action we can take&quot; when he announced the measures last week. </p>
<p>
     Essential services like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies remain open under the order, and residents can still go outside for exercise and to obtain groceries. </p>
<p>
     As the case number in New York rises, concerns have mounted in other parts of the country about people leaving the state and possibly spreading coronavirus. Earlier this week, administration officials urged anyone leaving New York to self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Monday directing travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to self-isolate for that period, and said violations of the order would amount to a criminal offense. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo on Thursday issued a similar order. Mr. Trump said on Saturday he had spoken to Mr. DeSantis. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They&apos;re having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers going down,&quot; Mr. Trump said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump, speaking in Norfolk, later Saturday, clarified that any restrictions wouldn&apos;t apply to &quot;people such as truckers from outside the New York area who are making deliveries or simply transiting through.&quot; </p>
<p>
     He also said the measures wouldn&apos;t affect trade &quot;in any way.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Standing in front of the Comfort, Mr. Trump said the hospital ship was &quot;stocked to the brim with equipment and medicines and everything you can think of.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the people of New York,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have all postponed balloting from April 28 to June 2. Mr. Cuomo said voting on June 23 would match New York&apos;s previously scheduled primary elections for the U.S. House of Representatives and the state legislature. </p>
<p>
     Also on Saturday, Mr. Trump approved a disaster declaration for Michigan and Massachusetts as the number of infections globally topped 600,000 and concerns grew about the financial toll. </p>
<p>
     The two states now have the fifth- and sixth-most infections in the U.S., respectively, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The disaster designation, which was also extended to the island territory of Guam, makes local governments eligible for additional federal funding. </p>
<p>
     The moves come a day after Mr. Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus plan, the largest economic relief package in history. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York amid increased testing. </p>
<p>
     The growth outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second- and third-most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000, respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections there rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>
<p>
     Overlapping travel bans and lockdowns have hammered businesses and led to millions of job losses, punctuated by a spike in U.S. unemployment claims to more than three million this week and a warning of a deep recession this year in trade bellwether Singapore. </p>
<p>
     With the pneumonia-causing virus spreading across the U.S. and Europe, after it was first detected in central China three months ago, governments around the world have ramped up efforts to limit people&apos;s movement and began imposing wide-ranging closures on businesses, restaurants and schools domestically in recent weeks. </p>
<p>
     France and Belgium on Friday extended their national lockdowns by two weeks, until mid-April. </p>
<p>
     The Chinese government is also wrestling with the economic blow, first from a prolonged halt in domestic business activities and now from weaker consumer sentiment and shrinking export demand as the coronavirus engulfs Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, China&apos;s top decision-making body said the government plans to boost spending by increasing its fiscal deficit this year, as well as speed up issuance of Treasury bonds and so-called local government special-purpose bonds to support funding of infrastructure projects, as part of the stimulus measures to curtail economic impact from the pandemic. </p>

Athletes Who Qualified for Tokyo 2020 Will Keep Spots in Delayed Games</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rachel Bachman </pre>
<p>
     After a few days of confusion, it became clear Saturday that teams and athletes who have qualified for spots in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will keep those slots whenever in 2021 the postponed Games take place. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It is clear that those athletes who have qualified for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 remain qualified,&quot; IOC president Thomas Bach said in a statement posted at @Olympics on Twitter on Saturday. &quot;This is a consequence of the fact that these Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, in agreement with Japan, will remain the Games of the XXXII Olympiad.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Tokyo Games, which had been scheduled to start July 24, this week were postponed until as late as summer 2021 due to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. On Friday, some governing bodies and athletes remained uncertain about whether they could keep the spots they had already earned for 2020 in the rescheduled 2021 Games. </p>
<p>
     But the confirmation that qualified spots will stay in place still leaves many American athletes -- including stars such as gymnast Simone Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky -- in limbo about who exactly will make the trip to Tokyo. </p>
<p>
     As of March 17, about 57% of the more than 11,000 athletes expected to compete in Tokyo had qualified for the Games, according to the IOC. But that includes quota spots earned by nations that don&apos;t specify which athletes will fill them. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. women&apos;s soccer and men&apos;s and women&apos;s gymnastics teams, for instance, already have qualified for the Games. But the actual athletes on each of those teams have yet to be selected, and probably won&apos;t be for months, a year or more. </p>
<p>
     The women&apos;s soccer roster will be named ahead of the Olympics, a U.S. Soccer spokesman said. The team announced its 18-player roster a little less than two months ahead of the Rio 2016 Games. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. gymnasts who will compete in Tokyo were set to have been picked at the end of the Olympic team trials, which were scheduled for June 25-28. Those trials won&apos;t take place this year. </p>
<p>
     Dozens of swimmers and more than 100 track and field athletes who make up a large share of Team USA, for instance, have through the Olympics qualification process secured generic spots for the Tokyo Games. </p>
<p>
     But those spots right now are mostly faceless. The U.S. track and field and U.S. swimming trials to select specific athletes to fill those spots, events that had been scheduled for June, won&apos;t take place this year and have yet to be rescheduled. </p>
<p>
     The swimming and track teams make up the bulk of the American medal haul, and the track team is by far the largest. A total of 128 track and field athletes competed for Team USA at Rio 2016, out of 555 athletes. </p>
<p>
     At least six individual Americans can exhale: the top three men and top three women at the Feb. 29 U.S. Olympic marathon trials in Atlanta, including 2016 Rio bronze medalist Galen Rupp and breakout women&apos;s winner Aliphine Tuliamuk. </p>
<p>
     Hawi Keflezighi, Tuliamuk&apos;s agent, said he wasn&apos;t seriously worried she would lose her spot. But, he said, &quot;It&apos;s good when the top of the pyramid gives this confirmation.&quot; </p>

Jeff Bezos&apos; Girlfriend&apos;s Brother Sues National Enquirer Publisher for Defamation</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jacob Gershman </pre>
<p>
     Michael Sanchez, the brother of Jeff Bezos&apos; girlfriend, is alleging in a lawsuit that the publisher of the National Enquirer defamed him when it claimed that he was the source of the tabloid&apos;s 2019 expos&#233; about the Amazon.com Inc. founder&apos;s extramarital affair. </p>
<p>
     The lawsuit, filed Friday in federal court in Los Angeles, centers around the publication of a January 2019 article in the National Enquirer exposing an affair between Mr. Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, Mr. Sanchez&apos;s sister, both of whom were married at the time. Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez remain in a relationship. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sanchez, a talent manager, alleges that National Enquirer parent American Media Inc. issued &quot;a false and defamatory press release&quot; in March 2019 saying Mr. Sanchez tipped off the tabloid about the affair and &quot;provided all of the materials&quot; for its investigation. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sanchez says he wasn&apos;t AMI&apos;s source about the affair and didn&apos;t leak nude photos. His lawsuit alleges it was AMI that &quot;plotted to dig up embarrassing information&quot; about Mr. Bezos to curry favor with President Trump and was aided by Saudi Arabia.  Saudi officials have rejected the idea that they helped the Enquirer. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sanchez claims his involvement in the story was limited to advising the couple on guarding the relationship&apos;s secrecy. </p>
<p>
     AMI&apos;s &quot;false and defamatory statements have, among other things, devastated Mr. Sanchez&apos;s professional career and reputation, destroyed the invaluable media relationships...and left him estranged from his own family,&quot; the lawsuit stated. </p>
<p>
     In a statement issued through a spokesman Saturday, AMI maintained that Mr. Sanchez &quot;sold the National Enquirer the story about his sister&apos;s secret affair and was the sole source for its reporting.&quot; AMI said the lawsuit was frivolous and motivated by greed. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We look forward to our day in court,&quot; said Jonathan M. Jenkins, a Los Angeles attorney representing Mr. Sanchez. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sanchez&apos;s complaint also names AMI&apos;s chairman and chief executive, David Pecker, and its chief content officer, Dylan Howard, as defendants. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Sanchez earlier this year sued Mr. Bezos for defamation in state court in Los Angeles. That complaint, which Mr. Bezos is seeking to dismiss, accuses representatives of the Amazon CEO of spreading false rumors that he leaked graphic photos of Mr. Bezos to the press. </p>
<p>
     In court documents, lawyers for Mr. Bezos and his security consultant, Gavin de Becker, have said Mr. Sanchez was the source of leaked personal text messages used for the January 2019 National Enquirer article about the affair. Neither Mr. Bezos nor Mr. de Becker have accused Mr. Sanchez of leaking nude photos to the Enquirer, court documents said. </p>
<p>
     Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating the alleged hack of Mr. Bezos&apos; phone and whether National Enquirer&apos;s publisher attempted to extort Mr. Bezos. In a blog post last year, Mr. Bezos accused American Media of trying to blackmail him by threatening to release embarrassing photos. </p>

Russia&apos;s Rosneft Plans to Sell All Assets Related to Venezuela</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Ann M. Simmons </pre>
<p>
     MOSCOW -- In an unexpected move, Russian state oil giant Rosneft announced that it would halt all activities in Venezuela and sell all its assets related to activities in the country. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Today, Rosneft entered into an agreement with a company 100% owned by the Government of the Russian Federation on the sale of shares and termination of its participation in all projects in Venezuela, including shares in the production enterprises of Petromonagas, Petroperija, Boqueron, Petromiranda and Petrovictoria, in oil-service enterprises and trading operations,&quot; the company said Saturday in a statement posted on its website. </p>
<p>
     Based on the agreement, all of Rosneft&apos;s assets and trading operations in and related to Venezuela would be sold, closed or liquidated, the company said. </p>
<p>
     Once the transaction is concluded, Rosneft would receive a package of its own shares in the amount of 9.6% as a settlement payment, the company added. </p>
<p>
     The Russian government confirmed that it had acquired assets from Rosneft, the official state news agency RIA Novosti reported. </p>
<p>
     The announcement comes less than three weeks after the Trump administration added a subsidiary of Rosneft, Geneva-based TNK Trading International SA, or TTI, to its financial blacklist for allegedly helping Venezuela sell its oil in violation of U.S. sanctions. That embargo followed Washington&apos;s decision in February to sanction Swiss-registered Rosneft Trading SA, warning that anyone caught doing business with Rosneft&apos;s subsidiary risks being sanctioned by the U.S. </p>
<p>
     The Obama administration first imposed sanctions on Rosneft and a slate of Russian businesses and officials in 2014 to put pressure on President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian separatists to cease their military activity in eastern Ukraine, where a slow-burning conflict was triggered following Moscow&apos;s 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula that was controlled by Kyiv. </p>
<p>
     The Trump administration has since been trying to curb the revenue from oil, gold and other sanctioned sectors that have been helping to keep Venezuelan President Nicol&#225;s Maduro in power. Mr. Putin vowed to back Mr. Maduro, a longtime ally, after Venezuelan parliament speaker Juan Guaid&#243; declared himself interim president in January last year, drawing support from several Latin American countries and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     Relations between Moscow and Caracas date to 1857, when Russia recognized Venezuela&apos;s independence. Venezuela recognized Russia as the Soviet Union&apos;s successor in 1991 and five years later the two countries signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation. </p>
<p>
     In recent years, the two nations undertook joint trade and economic investment projects, mainly involving the development of oil-and-gas fields. </p>
<p>
     Rosnetft and state-owned Petr&#243;leos de Venezuela are implementing five oil projects in Venezuela with a total production of 9 million tons a year -- 7% of the country&apos;s total production, state-controlled news agency TASS reported last year. The fate of these projects were unclear following Saturday&apos;s announcement. </p>

<p>
     There was no immediate reaction from Caracas. Calls and emails to the Information Ministry as wells as state oil monopoly Petr&#243;leos de Venezuela SA, or PdVSA, were not immediately returned. The government of President Nicol&#225;s Maduro, already reeling from a severe economic depression and low oil output amid U.S. sanctions, took another hit this week as U.S. prosecutors indicted the leftist leader and unveiled a $15 million reward for his capture for alleged narcotics trafficking. </p>
<p>
     The Obama administration first imposed sanctions on Rosneft and a slate of Russian businesses and officials in 2014 to put pressure on President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian separatists to cease their military activity in eastern Ukraine, where a slow-burning conflict was triggered following Moscow&apos;s 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula that was controlled by Kyiv. </p>

A Guide to State Coronavirus Lockdowns -- 12th Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jacob Gershman </pre>
<p>
     More than half of U.S. states have imposed lockdown measures restricting gathering and social contact, disrupting the lives of more than 100 million people and suspending the operations of thousands of businesses. </p>
<p>
     No state has completely walled off their residents from the outside. Generally, people are free to leave their homes to obtain food, supplies and medical care or to get exercise or care for loved ones. The rapidly drafted executive orders also exempt millions of jobs and services deemed too essential to shut down. </p>
<p>
     Some measures were more drastic than others. California Gov. Gavin Newsom effectively made it a crime to socialize outside the home, while New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham&apos;s measures are more advisory than mandatory. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo&apos;s lockdown came closest to quarantining the elderly and sick populations. And some leaders like New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote in broad protections for political and religious activity. </p>
<p>
     States have vowed to ensure compliance with the lockdowns, but it is unclear whether any of them can or will effectively enforce their mandates. </p>
<p>
     Here is a snapshot of the various lockdown orders and their key requirements. </p>
<p>
     CALIFORNIA </p>

<p>
     -- People outside must keep at least 6 feet of distance from each other. </p>
<p>
     -- Dine-in restaurants, bars and nightclubs, entertainment venues, gyms and fitness studios are closed. </p>
<p>
     -- Gas stations, pharmacies, grocery stores, convenience stores, banks and laundry services remain open. </p>
<p>
     CONNECTICUT </p>

Trump Considers Coronavirus Quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus, Jimmy Vielkind and Stella Yifan Xie </pre>
<p>
     President Trump said he is considering an &quot;enforceable quarantine&quot; in New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut and may make a decision as soon as later Saturday, as the nation&apos;s largest city quickly becomes an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We might not have to do it, but there&apos;s a possibility that sometime today we&apos;ll do a quarantine,&quot; Mr. Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington just before he boarded Air Force One for Norfolk, Va., where he plans to see off a Navy hospital ship that is heading to New York. He said the quarantine could last around two weeks. </p>
<p>
     The president didn&apos;t specify what a quarantine would entail, but said it could include restrictions on travel from New York and New Jersey. New York City alone has more than 23,000 cases, nearly a quarter of all the cases in the country. </p>
<p>
     The largest number of cases continues to be in the state of New York, where 52,318 people are infected and 728 had died from the virus as of Saturday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a morning briefing. </p>
<p>
     The Democratic governor said he didn&apos;t speak with Mr. Trump about a quarantine, but rather the pending arrival of the USNS Comfort, the hospital ship. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I haven&apos;t had those conversations. I don&apos;t even know what that means,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said at a Saturday press briefing. &quot;I don&apos;t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don&apos;t know what you would be accomplishing.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo has already ordered all nonessential businesses in the state to close and has said residents should stay home, calling it the &quot;most drastic action we can take&quot; when he announced the measures last week. </p>
<p>
     Essential services like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies remain open under the order, and residents can still go outside for exercise and to obtain groceries. </p>
<p>
     As the case number in New York rises, concerns have mounted in other parts of the country about people leaving the state and possibly spreading coronavirus. Earlier this week, administration officials urged anyone leaving New York to self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Monday directing travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to self-isolate for that period, and said violations of the order would amount to a criminal offense. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo on Thursday issued a similar order. Mr. Trump said on Saturday he had spoken to Mr. DeSantis. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They&apos;re having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers going down,&quot; Mr. Trump said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump, speaking in Norfolk, later Saturday, clarified that any restrictions wouldn&apos;t apply to &quot;people such as truckers from outside the New York area who are making deliveries or simply transiting through.&quot; </p>
<p>
     He also said the measures wouldn&apos;t affect trade &quot;in any way.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Standing in front of the Comfort, Mr. Trump said the hospital ship was &quot;stocked to the brim with equipment and medicines and everything you can think of.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the people of New York,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     Officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have all postponed balloting from April 28 to June 2. Mr. Cuomo said voting on June 23 would match New York&apos;s previously scheduled primary elections for the U.S. House of Representatives and the state legislature. </p>
<p>
     Also on Saturday, Mr. Trump approved a disaster declaration for Michigan and Massachusetts as the number of infections globally topped 600,000 and concerns grew about the financial toll. </p>
<p>
     The two states now have the fifth- and sixth-most infections in the U.S., respectively, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The disaster designation, which was also extended to the island territory of Guam, makes local governments eligible for additional federal funding. </p>
<p>
     The moves come a day after Mr. Trump signed a $2 trillion stimulus plan, the largest economic relief package in history. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York amid increased testing. </p>
<p>
     The growth outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second- and third-most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000, respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Spain on Saturday tightened its lockdown measures, requiring all workers in nonessential sectors to stay at home for two weeks starting Monday. Prime Minister Pedro S&#225;nchez said workers would be paid and make up for the lost hours in the future. By Saturday midday, the number of Spaniards who had contracted the virus rose to 72,000, 5,690 of whom had died. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections there rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>
<p>
     Overlapping travel bans and lockdowns have hammered businesses and led to millions of job losses, punctuated by a jump in U.S. unemployment claims to more than three million this week and a warning of a deep recession this year in trade bellwether Singapore. </p>
<p>
     With the pneumonia-causing virus spreading across the U.S. and Europe, after it was first detected in central China three months ago, governments around the world have ramped up efforts to limit people&apos;s movement and began imposing wide-ranging closures on businesses, restaurants and schools domestically in recent weeks. </p>
<p>
     France and Belgium on Friday extended their national lockdowns by two weeks, until mid-April. </p>
<p>
     The Chinese government is also wrestling with the economic blow, first from a prolonged halt in domestic business activities and now from weaker consumer sentiment and shrinking export demand as the coronavirus engulfs Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>
     On Friday, China&apos;s top decision-making body said the government plans to boost spending by increasing its fiscal deficit this year, as well as speed up issuance of Treasury bonds and so-called local government special-purpose bonds to support funding of infrastructure projects, as part of the stimulus measures to curtail economic impact from the pandemic. </p>

New York Postpones Democratic Primary to June 23</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Jimmy Vielkind </pre>
<p>
     New York will move its presidential primary from April to late June as deaths stemming from the new coronavirus pandemic escalate sharply. </p>
<p>
     More than 200 people in New York have died since Friday from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday afternoon, bringing the state&apos;s overall toll to 728. That includes a New York City police detective, the first uniformed NYPD officer to die of the disease, officials said. </p>
<p>
     The Democratic governor said officials are still working to increase hospital capacity for when the epidemic reaches its peak, which is projected in 14 to 21 days. Mr. Cuomo also planned to issue an executive order that would allow women giving birth in hospitals to be joined by a partner, his top aide Melissa DeRosa said. Some hospital systems had previously banned visitors, even for women in labor. </p>
<p>
     As of Saturday, there were 52,318 people in the state who had tested positive for the virus. More than half of those cases were in New York City. </p>
<p>
     New York election officials have for several weeks considered moving the Democratic nominating contest from April 28 to June 23, when the state had been previously scheduled to hold primary elections for congressional and state legislative seats. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo will sign an executive order moving the presidential primary as well as several special elections scheduled for the same date. Village elections slated for June 16 will also take place on June 23, a spokesman for the governor said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s wise to be bringing a lot of people to one location to vote,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said. </p>
<p>
     Good-government advocacy groups, including the League of Women Voters, applauded the change. New York isn&apos;t holding a Republican presidential primary because President Trump was the only candidate who qualified for the ballot. </p>
<p>
     The state&apos;s Democratic primary was shaping up to be Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders&apos;s last stand against former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Biden has amassed 1,215 delegates, compared with Mr. Sanders&apos;s 910. </p>
<p>
     Officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have all postponed balloting from April 28 to June 2. Along with New York, they were set to host the &quot;Acela Primary&quot; next month, a reference to the Amtrak express train that connects them. </p>
<p>
     The Democratic National Committee&apos;s rules, issued last year, reduce the number of delegates to its July convention from any state that holds its primary after June 9. In a statement, DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said the party was encouraging states to &quot;implement critical tools like vote by mail and other critical reforms to make it easier to vote.&quot; She said the party&apos;s rules committee would meet to determine what would happen to New York for violating the rule. </p>
<p>
     The delay in the state&apos;s Democratic primary came as the state and New York City faced grim news in its fight against the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said Detective Cedric Dixon, a 48-year-old assigned to the 32nd Precinct in Harlem, had died after a coronavirus infection. Previously, two civilian NYPD employees died from the disease. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We are hurting, we are crying and we continue to fight,&quot; Mr. Shea said. &quot;We simply have no other choice.&quot; </p>
<p>
     On Friday, 4,111 NYPD uniformed employees were on sick report -- 11.4% of the NYPD&apos;s uniformed workforce.  As of Friday, 442 uniformed members and 70 civilian members tested positive for the virus. </p>
<p>
     New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio planned to visit the United Nations to accept their donation to the city of 250,000 face masks. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo reiterated during his briefing in Albany that he didn&apos;t want to raise taxes as part of the state budget due on Tuesday because revenue has cratered. Labor unions and several Democratic members of the state Assembly and Senate are pushing to raise taxes on the wealthy to fund social programs. </p>
<p>
     The governor said he wouldn&apos;t tap an estimated $6 billion of additional Medicaid money that was approved earlier this month by Congress because doing so would prevent him from changing eligibility rules and reimbursement rates in the state&apos;s Medicaid program. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo hoped these changes could reduce cost overruns in the program, which provides health care to more than 6 million New Yorkers. Democrats who control the state Senate spoke out against the proposed reductions during the last week. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It seems wrong place, wrong time,&quot; state Sen. Brad Hoylman, a Democrat from Manhattan, said Friday. He said Mr. Cuomo&apos;s &quot;cuts would take the rug out from under hospitals as they fight a pandemic.&quot; </p>

Trump Considers Coronavirus Quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus, Jimmy Vielkind and Joseph De Avila </pre>
<p>
     President Trump said he is considering an &quot;enforceable quarantine&quot; in New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut and may make a decision as soon as later Saturday, as the nation&apos;s largest city quickly becomes an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We might not have to do it, but there&apos;s a possibility that sometime today we&apos;ll do a quarantine,&quot; Mr. Trump told reporters in Washington before heading to Norfolk, Va., where he saw off a Navy hospital ship heading for New York. </p>
<p>
     He said the quarantine could last around two weeks, but provided few details beyond saying the measure wouldn&apos;t affect trade or &quot;people such as truckers from outside the New York area who are making deliveries or simply transiting through.&quot; He also suggested the measures he is eyeing would only affect those seeking to travel out of those states, rather than within them. He said a more formal announcement could come soon. </p>
<p>
     If any quarantine restricted people&apos;s movements across state lines, it would represent one of the toughest measures the federal government has taken yet to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Mr. Trump has already blocked flights from China and much of Europe and asked Americans to adhere to social-distancing recommendations, but the stay-home measures that affect people most deeply have been ordered by governors. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump floated the idea of quarantining New York City and its surroundings as the hospital system there strained from a flood of coronavirus patients and other states began launching measures to keep out New Yorkers. </p>
<p>
     New York City alone has more than 23,000 cases, nearly a quarter of all the cases in the country. Overall, New York state leads the country in infections, with 52,318 confirmed cases and 728 deaths as of Saturday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during an afternoon briefing. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, both said a quarantine didn&apos;t come up during separate phone calls both men had recently with Mr. Trump. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said he hadn&apos;t spoken to the president about the quarantine idea yet. Mr. Cuomo questioned whether it would be effective. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I don&apos;t even know what that means,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said in response to a question about Mr. Trump&apos;s comments on a quarantine. &quot;I don&apos;t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don&apos;t know what you would be accomplishing.&quot; </p>
<p>
     All three governors have already ordered all nonessential businesses in the state to close and called for residents to stay home. Essential services like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies remain open under the order, and residents can still go outside for exercise and to obtain groceries. </p>
<p>
     They each said their moves already represent aggressive action against the virus&apos;s spread. &quot;Until further notified we are going to keep doing exactly what we are doing,&quot; said Mr. Murphy, whose state has 11,124 coronavirus cases as of Saturday afternoon and 140 deaths. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I look forward to speaking to the President directly about his comments and any further enforcement actions, because confusion leads to panic,&quot; Mr. Lamont said in a statement. </p>
<p>
     Concerns have mounted in other parts of the country about people leaving the New York City area and possibly spreading coronavirus. Earlier this week, administration officials urged anyone leaving New York to self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Monday directing travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to self-isolate for that period, and said violations of the order would amount to a criminal offense. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo on Thursday issued a similar order. Mr. Trump said on Saturday he had spoken to Mr. DeSantis. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They&apos;re having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers going down,&quot; Mr. Trump said. </p>
<p>
     Wendy Parmet, a public-health law professor at Northeastern University in Boston, said the executive branch has broad powers to protect the public health. Restrictions on interstate travel and commerce should, constitutionally, be put in place by the federal government, not individual states, she said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The situation that&apos;s been developing in the last few days feels like the Framers&apos; nightmare,&quot; she said, referring to states imposing quarantines on travelers from other states. &quot;We&apos;re not supposed to have Florida saying drop dead to New York...States can&apos;t set up borders. We have a Constitution.&quot; </p>
<p>
     She said whether the president&apos;s plan to quarantine the tri-state area passed constitutional muster would depend on the details of how it was done, and would have to be grounded in science about the public health. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The courts are deferential to public health powers in times of emergency,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump&apos;s comments overshadowed his visit to Norfolk, where he sent the hospital ship, USNS Comfort, on its way to New York to help take pressure off the city&apos;s health-care system. </p>
<p>
     Standing in front of the ship, Mr. Trump said it was &quot;stocked to the brim with equipment and medicines and everything you can think of.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the people of New York,&quot; he said. He reminded Americans that anyone leaving New York must self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Also on Saturday, Mr. Trump approved a disaster declaration for Michigan and Massachusetts. </p>
<p>
     The two states now have the fifth- and sixth-most infections in the U.S., respectively, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The disaster designation, which was also extended to the island territory of Guam, makes local governments eligible for additional federal funding. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo said New York would move its presidential primary from April 28 to June 23, to stop people from congregating while voting. Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have also postponed balloting. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York amid increased testing. </p>
<p>
     The growth outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second- and third-most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000, respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections there rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>
<p>
     Since it was first detected in central China three months ago, governments around the world have ramped up efforts to limit people&apos;s movement and began imposing wide-ranging closures on businesses, restaurants and schools domestically in recent weeks. </p>
<p>
     Overlapping travel bans and lockdowns have hammered businesses and led to millions of job losses. U.S. unemployment claims spiked to more than three million this week. There are warnings of a deep recession this year in trade bellwether Singapore. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump has indicated that he would like some Americans to begin returning to work by Easter, April 12. </p>

Emerging and Growth Markets, March 28th 2020</headline>

  Note: This is a web-version of the WSJ&apos;s weekly Emerging &amp; Growth Markets newsletter. The newsletter is a companion to  Strategic Intelligence (https://www.wsj.com/pro/strategic-intelligence/), an information resource focused on emerging markets that brings together the global news coverage of The Wall Street Journal with the analysis of market intelligence firm DuckerFrontier.

<p>
  Africa </p>
<p>
  African leaders call for $100 billion stimulus and help coordinating virus response. The head of the United Nations Commission for Africa, Vera Songwe, this week appealed to the World Bank, the European Central Bank, the IMF and other multilateral finance institutions to help provide a coordinated response to avert a potential continent-wide crisis in Africa as coronavirus cases rapidly mounted. </p>
<p>
  The ECA was working with a group of African finance ministers led by Ghana&apos;s Ken Ofori-Atta and South Africa&apos;s Tito Mboweni who said the continent needs immediate additional funding of $100 billion, and proposed a waiver of interest payments on $44 billion of debt as well as a waiver of interest payments on other obligations such as corporate bonds, trade finance and leases. </p>
<p>
  In a statement, the group of finance ministers said the waivers &quot;would provide immediate fiscal space and liquidity to the Governments, in their efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot; </p>
<p>
  The African Development Bank, which this week sold a $3 billion, three-year bond to help it tackle the outbreak, said that by mid-week some 3,000 people in 45 countries across Africa had tested positive for coronavirus. The ECA estimates the crisis could lop up to three percentage points off African countries&apos; GDP. </p>
<p>
  Kenya cuts taxes and imposes curfew to mitigate coronavirus shocks and spread. The Kenyan government cut taxes and imposed a curfew to mitigate the impact of coronavirus, George Mwangi reports. The tax cuts include 100% relief for people earning gross monthly income of up to KES24,000 or $266, President Uhuru Kenyatta said. </p>
<p>
  The government also slightly reduced sales tax, corporate tax and income tax. </p>
<p>
  The curfew from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. daily aims to limit movement and congregating of people large groups, Mr. Kenyatta said. </p>
<p>
  At least 38 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Kenya. </p>
<p>
  Africa&apos;s commodity producers face escalating challenges. Zambia&apos;s economy will likely slump into recession this year as Africa&apos;s No.2 copper and cobalt producer contends with divestment, deteriorating terms of trade and a weakening fiscal position, Nicholas Bariyo reports. The coronavirus pandemic will also have a major detrimental impact on the Democratic Republic of Congo&apos;s mining industry, threatening 60% of global supplies of cobalt, a key metal in electric-car manufacturing, according to economists at NKC African Economics. </p>
<p>
  The firm says Zambia&apos;s economy could contract by at least 3% due to renewed pressure from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, and inadequate health care will compound pre-pandemic pressures that included chronic electricity shortages that have hit mining output. Further compounding the woes, Glencore&apos;s Zambian unit says it&apos;s in the process of reviewing its operations citing effects of the pandemic and of lower copper prices, which are now down 23% since January. </p>
<p>
  A lockdown aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus in the Democratic Republic of Congo&apos;s copper and cobalt mining region is stalling mining operations. The shutdown requires all mine workers to stay home and affects all public roads and border crossings in the Haut-Katanga province, provincial governor Jacques Kyabula said. </p>
<p>
  Chad suspends crude oil processing. Chad&apos;s government has temporarily halted the processing of crude oil amid paralysis of the industry caused by measures taken to halt the spread of the coronavirus, Emmanuel Tumanjong writes. The country&apos;s Minister of Petrol, Mines and Energy Mahamat Hamid Koua said on Monday that overproduction had caused the company to lack space to stock reserves. </p>
<p>
  Chad, which recorded its first coronavirus case last week, has become a modest oil producer in the past two decades. The landlocked nation exported 35 million barrels of crude oil in 2019, down 13.6% from the 40.5 million barrels shipped out the previous year, according to data from the Cameroon Pipeline Steering and Monitoring Committee. </p>
<p>
  Asia </p>
<p>
  Lockdowns threaten jobs in Asian frontier markets. Millions of workers in garment-exporting nations such as Bangladesh, Myanmarand China could lose their jobs as retailers in Europe and beyond respond to coronavirus-inspired lockdowns by canceling orders, Jon Emont reports. Among the first to be hit by the consumer shutdown in the West are suppliers to the world&apos;s &quot;fast-fashion&quot; giants, which are now pausing or canceling factory orders, boding ill for Asian manufacturers of other, slower-moving consumer goods like cosmetics, smartphones and cars. </p>
<p>
  In an emotional video address to clothing brands, Rubana Huq, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, a trade group, said that if retailers don&apos;t pay for products they&apos;ve already ordered, 4.1 million Bangladeshi workers could lose their jobs. &quot;This is a social chaos we cannot afford,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
  Retail experts say the slowdown looks to be significantly worse than the financial crisis of 2008, when brands suffered from reduced consumer spending but could offer cut-rate sales and other deals to entice frugal customers. Then many factories were kept busy with orders, though overall demand was dented. Times are different now, said Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel at the University of Delaware, because shops and malls are closed in much of the U.S. and Europe. &quot;This time is a business lockdown,&quot; he said. &quot;The trade impact will be much larger.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Aung Myo Hein, the head of a Myanmar garment industry association, says the industry has already shed 10,000 jobs. He has cut workers&apos; hours at his own factories but has avoided layoffs for now, he said. </p>
<p>
  Middle East </p>
<p>
  S&amp;P downgrades Kuwait as oil-price fall highlights economic weakness. The current low level of oil prices will have a material negative impact on Kuwait&apos;s economy and financial health, ratings firm S&amp;P said this week. Announcing a cut in Kuwait&apos;s credit rating from AA to AA- the firm said the country&apos;s slow progress on reforms that would strengthen and diversify its economy contributed to its negative view. </p>
<p>
  The key reason for the downgrade is the fall in oil prices, which will act as a serious drag on Kuwait&apos;s heavily oil-dependent economy. But S&amp;P is also concerned that the majority of the country&apos;s oil exports go to Asia, &quot;where several countries have already been substantially affected by the coronavirus outbreak, leading to a contraction in oil demand.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Kuwait, whose stock market was one of the best performing in the world last year, has seen a sharp increase in confirmed coronavirus cases, prompting the government to shut down businesses and impose a partial curfew, creating an additional drag on the economy. </p>
<p>
  S&amp;P also downgraded Oman this week for similar reasons, but also because the firm is concerned about the oil exporter&apos;s heavy debt load, much of which is denominated in foreign currency, making it especially vulnerable to an unfavorable shift in investor sentiment. Concerns over the effect of low oil prices prompted S&amp;P to also downgrade Trinidad and Tobago, Nigeria and Angola. </p>
<p>
  The firm also downgraded Botswana in expectation of a &quot;prolonged weaker diamond export market.&quot; </p>
<p>
  Lebanon&apos;s GDP expected to shrink 12% in 2020. The director general of Lebanon&apos;s finance ministry, Alain Bifani, said the country&apos;s GDP is expected to contract by about 12% in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic compounds the nation&apos;s existing economic crisis, Alexander Gladstone writes. </p>
<p>
  Lebanon is currently preparing to restructure over $90 billion of sovereign debt after the government&apos;s finances were rocked by declining remittances of dollar deposits from the Lebanese overseas diaspora. </p>
<p>
  Lebanon&apos;s banking industry largely froze up last year amid anti-corruption protests and declining investor confidence, which resulted in remittances drying up and freezing the nation&apos;s financial system. </p>
<p>
  Latin America </p>
<p>
  Ecuador struggles to balance finances. Ecuador is asking creditors to accept delayed payments on some of its bonds as the South American nation tries to conserve its cash to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. As well as delaying payment of interest on some of its bonds, the country has appealed for an additional $2 billion from international lenders, including, possibly, at least $1 billion from China. </p>
<p>
  Coronavirus is spreading rapidly in Ecuador -- by Saturday morning there were more than 1,625 cases, up from fewer than 1,000 mid-week. The country, one of Latin America&apos;s key oil exporters, is also facing severe financial stress from the sharp recent decline in oil prices. </p>
<p>
  The IMF this week said it was providing $500 million in emergency credit and reallocate existing multilateral funds to its COVID-19 response, Mariana Zepeda, an analyst at DuckerFrontier said. The moves might not be enough, though. On Wednesday, S&amp;P downgraded Ecuador&apos;s credit rating. &quot;Ecuador is inching closer to default,&quot; Ms. Zepeda said. </p>
<p>
  U.S. charges Venezuelan president with drug trafficking. U.S. authorities charged Venezuelan President Nicol&#225;s Maduro with drug trafficking and offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest, Aruna Viswanatha, Jos&#233; de C&#243;rdoba and Ian Talley report. The move was part of a sweeping set of actions that targeted more than a dozen current and former Venezuelan officials and escalated the Trump administration&apos;s effort to unseat the leftist regime. </p>

Emerging and Growth Markets, March 28th 2020 -2-</headline>
<text>
<p>
  Prosecutors unsealed a series of criminal cases in New York, Florida and Washington on Thursday that they described as the product of a decadelong investigation and accuse Mr. Maduro and others of coordinating with a Colombian drug-trafficking guerilla group to flood the U.S. with tons of cocaine for the past 20 years. Attorney General William Barr described the Venezuelan regime as &quot;plagued by criminality and corruption,&quot; saying that it was dominated by a &quot;system constructed and controlled to enrich those at the highest levels of the government.&quot; </p>
<p>
  While Mr. Maduro remains in control of Venezuela, the U.S. and nearly 60 countries last year recognized the then-president of the country&apos;s national assembly, Juan Guaid&#243;, as the country&apos;s legitimate president. </p>
<p>
  Global </p>
<p>
  Coronavirus is advancing on poor nations, and the prognosis is troubling. The new coronavirus is now taking off in the world&apos;s poorest countries, which join the battle with even fewer weapons than developed nations, some of which have fumbled the pandemic&apos;s early stages, Saeed Shah and Joe Parkinson report. From Venezuela to Pakistan to the Democratic Republic of Congo -- and nearly every developing country between -- confirmed cases have started to surge in recent days, a sign the contagion is advancing exponentially, disease-control experts say. </p>
<p>
  &quot;Extraordinary action is required if we are to prevent a human catastrophe of enormous proportions in our country,&quot; said President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa. On Monday he announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown to be enforced by the military. </p>
<p>
  The health-care systems and social mechanisms to fight the virus in the world&apos;s poorest areas -- Africa, parts of Latin America, and Southeast and South Asia -- often aren&apos;t just at risk of being overwhelmed, many join the epidemic already overwhelmed. </p>
<p>
  Cases are rising sharply in Pakistan. By Wednesday morning, cases there had doubled from four days earlier to 991, official figures showed, a growth rate health experts say indicates rampant spread of the disease. By Saturday morning, the number was 1,415. </p>
<p>
  The Pakistani government believes cases could reach 20 million in the country if suitable steps aren&apos;t taken to stem the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>
  Debt defaults loom, but some investors see opportunity. The additional costs and economic disruption caused by the coronavirus could trigger a wave of debt defaults in smaller emerging markets, according to Edward Glossop, an economist at Capital Economics. &quot;A record number of sovereign dollar bonds are now trading at distressed levels,&quot; he said this week. &quot;The huge fiscal costs and humanitarian consequences of coronavirus could incentivize a slew of distressed governments to default on their debts,&quot; he added. </p>
<p>
  Zambia, Angola and Ecuador stand out as being perilously close to defaulting, but the sovereign bonds of more than a dozen other countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Tunisia, Tajikistan, Sri Lanka and Mongolia are trading at spreads of more than 10 percentage points over U.S. Treasurys. That spread has historically heralded defaults, though price changes don&apos;t necessarily mean a country will default. </p>
<p>
  Governments in developing economies ramped up foreign-currency borrowing in recent years as international capital markets opened up to emerging markets and borrowing costs tumbled amid foreign investors&apos; search for higher returns, Avantika Chilkoti and Caitlin Ostroff write. </p>
<p>
  Emerging markets borrowed $122.6 billion through sovereign dollar-denominated bonds last year, according to the latest Dealogic estimates, up from $63.3 billion in 2009. Nearly $24 billion of sovereign emerging-market dollar-denominated bonds are set to mature this year. </p>
<p>
  Some bond investors appear to be seeing opportunity amid the deterioration in credit conditions, though. </p>
<p>
  In what she described as &quot;the first mad scramble to buy risk,&quot; Nathalie Marschick, an analyst at investment bank Stifel, said investors were this week eager to buy selected sovereign and corporate bonds. &quot;We saw...sovereigns fly out of the traps and not look back, and the range of corporate bonds investors are looking to add is starting to grow as well,&quot; she said. </p>

&apos;This is War&apos;: President&apos;s Equipment Czar to Use Full Powers to Fight Coronavirus</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Alex Leary </pre>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- Peter Navarro, the Trump administration adviser chosen to oversee its wartime powers forcing private businesses into the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, said the full arsenal of federal measures are on the table, from raids on warehouses to compelling suppliers to retool factories. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The vast majority of this nation&apos;s unprecedented industrial mobilization will come patriotically, voluntarily, organically and innovatively,&quot; said Mr. Navarro, who was appointed by President Trump on Friday to take on the presidential task-force role of coordinating government-business cooperation in an effort to tackle the pandemic. </p>
<p>
     But Mr. Navarro refused to rule out tougher measures. &quot;This is war,&quot; he said in an exclusive interview with The Wall Street Journal. &quot;When there are bumps in the road, President Trump is going to knock them down immediately and unmercifully.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Facing criticism it has moved too slowly to combat the epidemic, the Trump administration on Friday invoked for the first time the Defense Production Act, a law from the Korean War era giving it the power to force businesses to divert production capacity in the name of a national emergency. </p>
<p>
     The target was General Motors Co., which President Trump said was moving too slowly in converting auto-production capabilities to the ventilators needed to relieve an anticipated flood of patients struggling to breath after contracting Covid-19. GM said it already had been working &quot;around the clock for weeks to meet this urgent need.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Navarro also said that under the DPA, the Justice Department is considering raids on warehouses and action against suppliers who could be impeding the swift delivery of protective equipment to health workers and other professionals. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The clear signal President Trump wants to send to anybody who thinks they can hoard or price gouge is that they must immediately move their inventory out of their warehouses and offer them at a fair price,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;To do anything less is to have blood on their hands,&quot; Mr. Navarro said. </p>
<p>
     By choosing Mr. Navarro as his DPA policy coordinator, Mr. Trump has enlisted a brusque loyalist and one of the more polarizing figures in the administration. Navarro, 70 years old, is the director of the thinly staffed Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, and his role has grown more expansive as the president&apos;s team has continued to churn. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Navarro for weeks has been working on supply-chain issues related to the crisis and has coordinated directly with companies to marshal equipment, including FedEx Corp. Chief Executive Fred Smith to distribute hundreds of thousands of specialized testing swabs flown in from Italy and smoothing a contract with Honeywell International Inc. to produce N95 respirators. </p>
<p>
     A California economics professor and one-time Democratic candidate for Congress, Mr. Navarro arrived on Mr. Trump&apos;s radar during the 2016 campaign because of his books on China as a growing threat to U.S. dominance. </p>
<p>
     The president has often leaned on Mr. Navarro during internal policy debates over trade, calling out, &quot;Where&apos;s my Peter?&quot; when feeling outnumbered by those who have objected to protectionist measures. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Navarro&apos;s writings have touched on pandemics in the past. &quot;China has become the world&apos;s prime breeding ground for new and exotic strains of influenza and other viruses,&quot; he wrote in the 2006 book, &quot;The Coming China Wars.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;As soon as I saw a novel coronavirus emerge in Wuhan, my radar went up, &quot; Mr. Navarro said on Saturday. He accused Chinese officials who visited the White House in mid-January for the signing of the phase one trade deal of suppressing crucial information -- even possibly transmitting the disease. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They shook our hands. We broke bread with them,&quot; he said. &quot;They smiled and left with nary a warning about the severity of the crisis.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The Chinese Embassy in Washington in a statement Saturday pointed to comments made earlier this month by Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, who provided a timeline of contacts between officials in both countries. He also noted Mr. Trump&apos;s praise of China&apos;s response on Twitter. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We hope the U.S. side will respect facts and the international consensus and keep its own house in order rather than slander others and shift responsibility,&quot; Mr. Shuang said. </p>
<p>
     During a press briefing Friday in which Mr. Trump named him as the DPA coordinator, Mr. Navarro cast it in historical terms. &quot;We are engaged in the most significant industrial mobilization since World War II,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;Over the last several days, we ran into roadblocks with GM,&quot; Mr. Navarro added. &quot;We cannot afford to lose a single day, particularly over the next 30 to 60 days. So President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act as a way of enhancing and accelerating this mobilization. I salute him for doing so. It&apos;s going to make my job so much easier.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump, meantime, has drawn criticism for an uneven approach to the issue. Despite invoking DPA on March 18, the president was reluctant to use it, facing pushback from business groups and some of his own advisers, who have raised concerns about the effect such a move could have on the economy. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Navarro is now overseeing potential further use of the emergency powers, though he, too, prefers the less hostile approach. In the interview Saturday, he said he is in talks, along with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services, with about a dozen ventilator companies and that progress was being made. </p>
<p>
     &quot;It&apos;s a mission, not a job,&quot; Mr. Navarro said of his role. Underneath a clock in his office is a sign that reads Trump Time. Mr. Navarro translated that to mean getting things done &quot;as soon as humanly possible. Most times that means leveraging the full power of the federal government. Sometimes it means smashing through the bureaucratic red tape.&quot; </p>

Trump Considers Coronavirus Quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- 2nd Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus, Jimmy Vielkind and Joseph De Avila </pre>
<p>
     President Trump said he is considering an &quot;enforceable quarantine&quot; in New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut, drawing a sharp response from governors there as the nation&apos;s largest city quickly becomes an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We might not have to do it, but there&apos;s a possibility that sometime today we&apos;ll do a quarantine,&quot; Mr. Trump told reporters in Washington before heading to Norfolk, Va., where he saw off a Navy hospital ship heading for New York. </p>
<p>
     He said the quarantine could last around two weeks, but provided few details beyond saying the measure wouldn&apos;t affect trade or &quot;people such as truckers from outside the New York area who are making deliveries or simply transiting through.&quot; He also suggested the measures he is eyeing would only affect those seeking to travel out of those states, rather than within them. He said a more formal announcement could come as soon as Saturday night. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo immediately rejected the idea, suggesting the president couldn&apos;t be serious because there had been no consultations with the states. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo said a federal quarantine on the country&apos;s financial engine would unleash chaos on the stock market, cause more damage to the economy and set off a series of legal disputes with states. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This would be a declaration of war on states, a federal declaration of war,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said on CNN Saturday evening. &quot;A lockdown is what they did in Wuhan, China, and we&apos;re not in China...I don&apos;t believe it&apos;d be legal.&quot; </p>
<p>
     The president&apos;s advisers have told him that if he were to restrict travel out of New York and other states, it wouldn&apos;t be necessary to &quot;bring the hammer&quot; by physically preventing people from leaving, a person familiar with the discussions said. The White House believes that if the president ordered people not to leave the area, most would listen, the person said. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the person said, officials haven&apos;t discussed bringing in the military or the National Guard to enforce the restrictions. &quot;We&apos;re not going to need much,&quot; the president said Saturday about enforcement of new measures. </p>
<p>
     If any quarantine restricted people&apos;s movements across state lines, it would represent one of the toughest measures the federal government has taken yet to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Mr. Trump has already blocked flights from China and much of Europe and asked Americans to adhere to social-distancing recommendations, but the stay-home measures that affect people most deeply have been ordered by governors. </p>
<p>
     New York City alone has more than 23,000 cases, nearly a quarter of all the cases in the country. Overall, New York state leads the country in infections, with 52,318 confirmed cases and 728 deaths as of Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said during an afternoon briefing. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo and the Democratic governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, Phil Murphy and Ned Lamont, have already ordered all nonessential businesses in the state to close and called for residents to stay home. Essential services like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies remain open under the order, and residents can still go outside for exercise and to obtain groceries. </p>
<p>
     They each said their moves already represent aggressive action against the virus&apos;s spread. &quot;Until further notified we are going to keep doing exactly what we are doing,&quot; said Mr. Murphy, whose state has 11,124 coronavirus cases as of Saturday afternoon and 140 deaths. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I look forward to speaking to the President directly about his comments and any further enforcement actions, because confusion leads to panic,&quot; Mr. Lamont said in a statement. </p>
<p>
     Concerns have mounted in other parts of the country about people leaving the New York City area and possibly spreading coronavirus. Earlier this week, administration officials urged anyone leaving New York to self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Monday directing travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to self-isolate for that period, and said violations of the order would amount to a criminal offense. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo on Thursday issued a similar order. Mr. Trump said on Saturday he had spoken to Mr. DeSantis. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They&apos;re having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers going down,&quot; Mr. Trump said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo said other states&apos; measures to keep New Yorkers out were &quot;reactionary.&quot; He said he would sue Rhode Island if it doesn&apos;t stop enforcing travel restrictions on New Yorkers. </p>
<p>
     Legal experts differed on whether the federal government could restrict, en masse, the movements of New York City area residents. </p>
<p>
     Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said the quarantine broached by Mr. Trump would be unconstitutional and unprecedented. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The power to regulate interstate commerce, including the spread of infectious diseases, resides exclusively in Congress,&quot; he said. &quot;In this case, the president hasn&apos;t even consulted Congress or the governor of New York. He&apos;d be acting unilaterally in ways he has no power to do.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Gostin said governors, like Mr. Cuomo, would have multiple ways to push back if Mr. Trump ordered a quarantine of their states. They could sue, and they could direct the state police and public-health authorities not to enforce the order. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Supreme Court has said expressly that the federal government has no power to direct a governor to execute the president&apos;s orders,&quot; Mr. Gostin said. &quot;The president would have to call in the United States military to guard the border.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Wendy Parmet, a public-health law professor at Northeastern University in Boston, said the executive branch has broad powers to protect the public health. Restrictions on interstate travel and commerce should, constitutionally, be put in place by the federal government, not individual states, she said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re not supposed to have Florida saying drop dead to New York,&quot; she said. &quot;States can&apos;t set up borders. We have a Constitution.&quot; </p>
<p>
     She said whether the president&apos;s plan to quarantine the tri-state area passed constitutional muster would depend on the details of how it was done, and would have to be grounded in science about the public health. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The courts are deferential to public health powers in times of emergency,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump&apos;s comments overshadowed his visit to Norfolk, where he sent the hospital ship, USNS Comfort, on its way to New York to help take pressure off the city&apos;s health-care system. </p>
<p>
     Standing in front of the ship, Mr. Trump said it was &quot;stocked to the brim with equipment and medicines and everything you can think of.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the people of New York,&quot; he said. He reminded Americans that anyone leaving New York must self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York amid increased testing. There are now more than 2,000 deaths from the virus in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. </p>
<p>
     In a sign that other states were coming under pressure, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said coronavirus patients admitted to intensive-care units had doubled to 410 on Saturday. Hospitalizations were up 38.6% from a day earlier, with more than 1,000 Covid patients now in California hospitals. </p>
<p>
     &quot;That&apos;s a significant, sizable increase,&quot; he said. &quot;If trends continue on those lines, then we will begin to manifest conditions that are very familiar to people on the East Coast.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Authorities also reported the death of a New York Police Department detective and an Illinois infant who had Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     The virus&apos;s growth in the U.S. outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second- and third-most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000, respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections there rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>

Gilead Limits Access to Experimental Coronavirus Drug Due to High Demand</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Joseph Walker </pre>
<p>
     Gilead Sciences Inc. will stop considering individual emergency requests for its experimental coronavirus drug, except in certain circumstances, as it grapples with overwhelming demand, the company said Saturday. </p>
<p>
     Gilead and other researchers are conducting multiple clinical trials of the drug, remdesivir, in patients hospitalized by the virus. Initial study data will be available in the coming weeks, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O&apos;Day wrote in an open letter posted on the company&apos;s website. </p>
<p>
     Not all patients can get into the studies, either because they don&apos;t meet the clinical eligibility criteria or aren&apos;t being treated at a hospital participating in the trials. For severely ill patients who can&apos;t get into a study, doctors can make a &quot;compassionate use&quot; request for unapproved drugs, which have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This works well when there is only a limited number of requests -- as is normally the case -- but the system cannot support and process the overwhelming number of applications we have seen with Covid-19,&quot; Mr. O&apos;Day said in the letter, referring to the disease caused by the new coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Gilead has provided remdesivir to more than 1,000 Covid-19 patients through its compassionate-use program, Mr. O&apos;Day wrote. Going forward, however, Gilead will only consider individual requests for pregnant women and children. For all other patients, Gilead is setting up an &quot;expanded access&quot; program under which doctors and hospitals can apply for emergency use for multiple severely ill patients at a time. </p>
<p>
     Gilead said it would take time to set up a network of hospitals that can make the group requests, but initial sites in the U.S. were up and running as of Friday, and more sites in additional countries would be activated soon. </p>

North Korea Launches at Least One Projectile Off Eastern Coast</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Timothy W. Martin </pre>
<p>
     SEOUL -- North Korea launched a projectile off its east coast Sunday morning, South Korea&apos;s military said, as Pyongyang continues to a habit of weapons testing amid a lull in disarmament talks with the U.S. </p>
<p>
     The Sunday launch represented the fourth test this month by the Kim Jong Un regime. South Korea&apos;s military didn&apos;t immediately report the weapon type or distance traveled. The prior three tests have all involved what Seoul assumes to be short-range missiles. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. and North Korea haven&apos;t sat down for formal denuclearization talks since October. But the two countries&apos; leaders had recently corresponded about the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump confirmed sending a letter to Mr. Kim and offering the country help. Mr. Kim&apos;s sister, in a March 22 state-media report, said the president&apos;s letter had praised the North Korean Covid-19 response. </p>
<p>
     North Korea has repeatedly said it has no confirmed cases of coronavirus, an assertion viewed skeptically by many diplomats and medical experts familiar with Pyongyang&apos;s health-care system. Washington and Pyongyang are unlikely to prioritize denuclearization talks while the two countries deal with the coronavirus threat, the security experts said. </p>
<p>
     Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at a Wednesday meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of Seven nations, said countries should remain united in calling on North Korea to return to the negotiating table. Mr. Pompeo also urged other nations to keep applying diplomatic and economic pressure over the North&apos;s &quot;illegal nuclear and ballistic missile program.&quot; </p>
<p>
     North Korea hasn&apos;t conducted a nuclear test or launched an intercontinental ballistic missile in more than two years, behavior that the Trump administration often points to as a sign its diplomatic approach is working. But Pyongyang has performed more than a dozen short-range weapons tests over the past year. </p>
<p>
     In a policy speech released on Jan. 1, Mr. Kim said the country no longer felt bound to a moratorium on long-range weapons testing, while promising to soon reveal a new strategic weapon. </p>
<p>
     North Korean state media didn&apos;t have immediate comment on Sunday&apos;s launch. </p>

North Korea Launches Two Short-Range Ballistic Missiles Off Eastern Coast</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Timothy W. Martin </pre>
<p>
     SEOUL -- North Korea launched two apparent short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast Sunday morning, South Korea&apos;s military said, as Pyongyang continues to a habit of weapons testing amid a lull in disarmament talks with the U.S. </p>
<p>
     The Sunday launch represented the fourth test this month by the Kim Jong Un regime. The two presumed missiles were fired around 6:10 a.m. local time from near the North&apos;s eastern coastal city of Wonsan before splashing into the waters between Korea and Japan. The projectiles covered a distance of about 140 miles and soared about 19 miles high. </p>
<p>
     The prior three tests have also involved what Seoul assumes to be short-range missiles. South Korea&apos;s military called the launches &quot;highly inappropriate&quot; and urged the North to halt such behavior as the world deals with the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. and North Korea haven&apos;t sat down for formal denuclearization talks since October. But the two countries&apos; leaders had recently corresponded about the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump confirmed sending a letter to Mr. Kim and offering the country help. Mr. Kim&apos;s sister, in a March 22 state-media report, said the president&apos;s letter had praised the North Korean Covid-19 response. </p>
<p>
     North Korea has repeatedly said it has no confirmed cases of coronavirus, an assertion viewed skeptically by many diplomats and medical experts familiar with Pyongyang&apos;s health-care system. Washington and Pyongyang are unlikely to prioritize denuclearization talks while the two countries deal with the coronavirus threat, the security experts said. </p>
<p>
     Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at a Wednesday meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of Seven nations, said countries should remain united in calling on North Korea to return to the negotiating table. Mr. Pompeo also urged other nations to keep applying diplomatic and economic pressure over the North&apos;s &quot;illegal nuclear and ballistic missile program.&quot; </p>
<p>
     North Korea hasn&apos;t conducted a nuclear test or launched an intercontinental ballistic missile in more than two years, behavior that the Trump administration often points to as a sign its diplomatic approach is working. But Pyongyang has performed more than a dozen short-range weapons tests over the past year. </p>
<p>
     In a policy speech released on Jan. 1, Mr. Kim said the country no longer felt bound to a moratorium on long-range weapons testing, while promising to soon reveal a new strategic weapon. </p>
<p>
     North Korean state media didn&apos;t have immediate comment on Sunday&apos;s launch. </p>

Trump Decides Against Quarantine for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut -- 3rd Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus, Jimmy Vielkind and Joseph De Avila </pre>
<p>
     President Trump late Saturday said he would not seek a quarantine on New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut after raising the idea earlier in the day and said his administration would instead issue a &quot;strong travel advisory&quot; for the area, as the nation&apos;s largest city quickly becomes an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said he had directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue the travel advisory and that more details would be released later in the evening. He said he had made the decision in consultation with the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. </p>
<p>
     The president&apos;s assertion earlier in the day that he was considering imposing a quarantine on those states for a few weeks drew swift and harsh blowback from governors, who questioned why they hadn&apos;t been consulted first and suggested they didn&apos;t believe the move would be legal. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had called the quarantine idea a &quot;declaration of war on states&quot; that would crash financial markets and results in legal challenges. </p>
<p>
     &quot;A lockdown is what they did in Wuhan, China, and we&apos;re not in China,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said on CNN Saturday evening. </p>
<p>
     The president had indicated he didn&apos;t plan to physically prevent people from leaving those states, telling reporters earlier in the day that it wouldn&apos;t be necessary to bring in the military or the National Guard. The president&apos;s advisers have told him that most people would listen to an order from the president not to leave the states, and that it wouldn&apos;t be necessary to &quot;bring the hammer&quot; by physically blocking their exit, a person familiar with the discussions said. </p>
<p>
     If any quarantine restricted people&apos;s movements across state lines, it would represent one of the toughest measures the federal government has taken yet to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Mr. Trump already has blocked flights from China and much of Europe and asked Americans to adhere to social-distancing recommendations, but the stay-home measures that affect people most deeply have been ordered by governors. </p>
<p>
     New York City alone has more than 23,000 cases, nearly a quarter of all the cases in the country. Overall, New York state leads the country in infections, with 52,318 confirmed cases and 728 deaths as of Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said during an afternoon briefing. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo and the Democratic governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, Phil Murphy and Ned Lamont, already have ordered all nonessential businesses in the state to close and called for residents to stay home. Essential services like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies remain open under the order, and residents still can go outside for exercise and to obtain groceries. </p>
<p>
     They each said their moves already represent aggressive action against the virus&apos;s spread. &quot;Until further notified we are going to keep doing exactly what we are doing,&quot; said Mr. Murphy, whose state has 11,124 coronavirus cases as of Saturday afternoon and 140 deaths. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I look forward to speaking to the President directly about his comments and any further enforcement actions, because confusion leads to panic,&quot; Mr. Lamont said in a statement. </p>
<p>
     Concerns have mounted in other parts of the country about people leaving the New York City area and possibly spreading coronavirus. Earlier this week, administration officials urged anyone leaving New York to self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Monday directing travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to self-isolate for that period, and said violations of the order would amount to a criminal offense. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo on Thursday issued a similar order. Mr. Trump said on Saturday he had spoken to Mr. DeSantis. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They&apos;re having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers going down,&quot; Mr. Trump said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo said other states&apos; measures to keep New Yorkers out were &quot;reactionary.&quot; He said he would sue Rhode Island if it doesn&apos;t stop enforcing travel restrictions on New Yorkers. </p>
<p>
     Legal experts differed on whether the federal government could restrict, en masse, the movements of New York City area residents. </p>
<p>
     Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said the quarantine broached by Mr. Trump would be unconstitutional and unprecedented. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The power to regulate interstate commerce, including the spread of infectious diseases, resides exclusively in Congress,&quot; he said. &quot;In this case, the president hasn&apos;t even consulted Congress or the governor of New York. He&apos;d be acting unilaterally in ways he has no power to do.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Gostin said governors, like Mr. Cuomo, would have multiple ways to push back if Mr. Trump ordered a quarantine of their states. They could sue, and they could direct the state police and public-health authorities not to enforce the order. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Supreme Court has said expressly that the federal government has no power to direct a governor to execute the president&apos;s orders,&quot; Mr. Gostin said. &quot;The president would have to call in the United States military to guard the border.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Wendy Parmet, a public-health law professor at Northeastern University in Boston, said the executive branch has broad powers to protect the public health. Restrictions on interstate travel and commerce should, constitutionally, be put in place by the federal government, not individual states, she said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re not supposed to have Florida saying drop dead to New York,&quot; she said. &quot;States can&apos;t set up borders. We have a Constitution.&quot; </p>
<p>
     She said whether the president&apos;s plan to quarantine the tri-state area passed constitutional muster would depend on the details of how it was done, and would have to be grounded in science about the public health. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The courts are deferential to public health powers in times of emergency,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump&apos;s comments overshadowed his visit to Norfolk, where he sent the hospital ship, USNS Comfort, on its way to New York to help take pressure off the city&apos;s health-care system. </p>
<p>
     Standing in front of the vessel, Mr. Trump said it was &quot;stocked to the brim with equipment and medicines and everything you can think of.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the people of New York,&quot; he said. He reminded Americans that anyone leaving New York must self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York amid increased testing. There are now more than 2,000 deaths from the virus in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. </p>
<p>
     In a sign that other states were coming under pressure, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said coronavirus patients admitted to intensive-care units had doubled to 410 on Saturday. Hospitalizations were up 38.6% from a day earlier, with more than 1,000 Covid-19 patients now in California hospitals. </p>
<p>
     &quot;That&apos;s a significant, sizable increase,&quot; he said. &quot;If trends continue on those lines, then we will begin to manifest conditions that are very familiar to people on the East Coast.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Authorities also reported the death of a New York Police Department detective and an Illinois infant who had Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     The virus&apos;s growth in the U.S. outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second- and third-most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000, respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections there rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>

Gilead Revamps Process for Emergency Requests for Experimental Coronavirus Drug -- Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Joseph Walker </pre>
<p>
     Gilead Sciences Inc. will stop considering individual emergency requests for its experimental coronavirus drug, except in certain circumstances, as it grapples with overwhelming demand, the company said Saturday. </p>
<p>
     The move is part of the drugmaker&apos;s overhaul of the process for doctors requesting emergency use of the experimental drug remdesivir outside of clinical trials. Gilead said it is making the changes because it can&apos;t handle all the requests it is getting, and hoping the revamping will eventually speed up the process and expand access to more patients. </p>
<p>
     Gilead and other researchers are conducting multiple clinical trials of remdesivir in patients hospitalized by the virus. Initial study data will be available in the coming weeks, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O&apos;Day wrote in an open letter posted on the company&apos;s website. </p>
<p>
     Not all patients can get into the studies, either because they don&apos;t meet the clinical eligibility criteria or aren&apos;t being treated at a hospital participating in the trials. For severely ill patients who can&apos;t get into a study, doctors can make a &quot;compassionate use&quot; request for unapproved drugs, which have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. </p>
<p>
     &quot;This works well when there is only a limited number of requests -- as is normally the case -- but the system cannot support and process the overwhelming number of applications we have seen with Covid-19,&quot; Mr. O&apos;Day said in the letter, referring to the disease caused by the new coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     Gilead has provided remdesivir to more than 1,000 Covid-19 patients through its compassionate-use program, Mr. O&apos;Day wrote. Going forward, however, Gilead will only consider individual requests for pregnant women and children. For all other patients, Gilead is setting up an &quot;expanded access&quot; program under which doctors and hospitals can apply for emergency use for multiple severely ill patients at a time. </p>
<p>
     Gilead said it would take time to set up a network of hospitals that can make the group requests, but initial sites in the U.S. were up and running as of Friday, and more sites in additional countries would be activated soon. </p>

Census Bureau Delays Field Work on 2020 Census Again Over Coronavirus</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Paul Overberg </pre>
<p>
     The Census Bureau will extend its suspension of Census 2020 field work until April 15, two weeks longer than originally planned, due to the coronavirus epidemic. </p>
<p>
     The delay, announced Saturday, will further compress the timetable to count all Americans. The process is scheduled to end Aug. 14 to meet a legal deadline that requires results be delivered by Dec. 31. The count was originally scheduled to end July 31. </p>
<p>
     The delay continues a freeze on the hiring and training of tens of thousands of workers in preparation for the largest phase of the census, a canvass this summer of millions of homes that haven&apos;t responded. </p>
<p>
     Mailed invitations to complete the census reached most households earlier this month. Through Friday, 32% had responded online, by phone or by mail. </p>
<p>
     The delay also affects door-to-door delivery of census forms to about 10 million homes, mostly in rural areas or where residents don&apos;t get mail delivery at home. </p>
<p>
     Plans to count the homeless and people with no fixed home, such as those living in marinas or recreational vehicle parks, had already been pushed back from around the start of April until late April. </p>
<p>
     Thousands of groups that had pledged to promote the census to their members or communities also have been forced to cancel planned events and to work online or by phone. </p>

Alaska Air Group, Ford Motor, CVS Health: Stocks That Defined the Week</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Francesca Fontana </pre>
<p>
     Alaska Air Group Inc. </p>
<p>
     Uncle Sam wants to get into the airline business. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated that the U.S. government would take stakes in beleaguered airline carriers in exchange for billions of dollars in direct grants to the companies, part of a $2 trillion economic rescue package, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The legislation passed this week includes $25 billion in direct funding for passenger air carriers on top of loans and loan guarantees available through the Treasury. Alaska Air Group shares gained 8.9% Thursday. </p>
<p>
     MGM Resorts International </p>
<p>
     MGM Resorts is rolling the dice on a new boss as it rides out the coronavirus pandemic. Bill Hornbuckle, the company&apos;s president and chief operating officer, is taking over as acting chief executive after exiting Chief Executive Jim Murren, who announced his plans to leave last month, stepped down from his post on March 22. MGM Resorts also said board member Paul Salem, of Providence Equity Partners, will succeed Mr. Murren as chairman. MGM Resorts and other casino operators have closed down temporarily and implemented widespread layoffs and furloughs in response to the spreading coronavirus. Shares gained 0.4% Monday. </p>
<p>
     Occidental Petroleum Corp. </p>
<p>
     Occidental Petroleum is cutting salaries for its U.S. employees by up to 30%, one of many U.S. companies looking to slash expenses as the new coronavirus spreads across the country. The Houston company is facing plunging oil prices, high debt from an ill-timed acquisition and falling demand due to a halt in economic activity because of the new coronavirus. Chief Executive Vicki Hollub&apos;s salary will be reduced by 81% and the oil-and-chemical company&apos;s top executives&apos; pay will be cut by an average of 68%, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, while employee bonuses and perks, such as gym memberships and commuter subsidies, are set to end in April. Occidental shares rose 12% Wednesday. </p>
<p>
     Ford Motor Co. </p>
<p>
     Ford and its rival General Motors Co. agreed to help produce equipment for those suffering from the new coronavirus as concerns about machinery shortages mounted in certain areas of the U.S. Ford and 3M Co. employees are working to boost manufacturing of 3M&apos;s respirators, the companies said Tuesday, and are also working to develop a new respirator that could be produced in a Ford plant. GM said Friday it would work with a partner to make ventilators at one of its plants. Separately, General Electric Co.&apos;s health-care unit and Ford are working to expand production of a simplified version of a GE ventilator that could help patients with respiratory problems tied to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Ford shares gained 23% Tuesday. </p>
<p>
     CVS Health Corp. </p>
<p>
     Pharmaceuticals are still plentiful but cleaning supplies and paper products are under more strain. That was the message Tuesday from the chief executive of CVS Health, who spoke virtually at The Wall Street Journal&apos;s Health Forum. He said the company&apos;s supply of pharmaceuticals remains steady even as the new coronavirus roils global manufacturing and distribution markets and that the pharmacy giant hasn&apos;t experienced any difficulty securing important medications for people with chronic disease. But the pandemic has taxed its operations in other ways. Its retail operations for household basics are under strain as demand intensifies for cleaning supplies and other products. The company is seeking to fill 50,000 positions and offering its workforce bonuses and child care to keep them on the job. CVS shares added 2.4% Tuesday. </p>
<p>
     Walt Disney Co. </p>
<p>
     More housebound consumers are streaming videos, but advertisers aren&apos;t following. The streaming uptick experienced by Walt Disney&apos;s Hulu, AT&amp;T Inc.&apos;s HBO and Amazon.com Inc. has created more available ad time, but advertiser demand is falling as much of U.S. economic activity stalls. SpotX Inc., which helps publishers sell video ads, said travel, hospitality and real-estate marketers cut ad spending through its platform by more than 70% from March 16 to March 22, compared with the previous seven days. But there are some promising areas: SpotX saw gaming ad spend nearly quadruple, while it rose 97% for lotteries and 89% for alcohol. Disney shares rose 4.6% Thursday. </p>
<p>
     Comcast Corp. </p>
<p>
     NBCUniversal Chief Executive Jeff Shell has tested positive for Covid-19 and is recovering at home, the most senior media executive known to have tested positive for the new coronavirus. The company&apos;s NBC News network also has lost a longtime staffer to the virus; the network said that audio technician Larry Edgeworth died from complications related to coronavirus on March 20. Mr. Shell succeeded Steve Burke as chief executive of the Comcast Corp. unit earlier this year. In his Thursday memo to staff, Mr. Shell wrote that he has been able to work remotely in Los Angeles and is improving every day. Comcast shares rose along with the broader market Thursday, gaining 9.4%. </p>

Mall Owner Taubman Centers Tells Tenants They Still Have to Pay Rent</headline>
<text>
<p>
  By Esther Fung </p>
<p>
  Mall owner Taubman Centers has responded to multiple requests for rent relief in April by telling tenants in a memo that they still have to pay rent despite mandated and voluntary store closures to curb the spread of the coronavirus. </p>
<p>
  The landlord, which owns 21 properties in the U.S. including the Beverly Center in Los Angeles, said it understands that times are going to be hard for some tenants. </p>
<p>
  &quot;We are attempting to navigate through this situation in the best way we can, while being as flexible as we can with our tenants in light of our ongoing obligations,&quot; said Taubman&apos;s spokeswoman on Saturday. </p>
<p>
  &quot;The tenant memo does not replace our willingness to talk to each tenant about their respective challenges and help them chart an appropriate course for the future,&quot; she added. </p>
<p>
  Property landlords have obligations including staff salaries, mortgage payments, property taxes and maintenance. </p>

Trump Decides Against Quarantine for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut -- 3rd Update</headline>
<text>
<pre>
By Rebecca Ballhaus, Ian Lovett and Jimmy Vielkind </pre>
<p>
     President Trump late Saturday said he would not seek a quarantine on New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut after raising the idea earlier in the day and said his administration would instead issue a &quot;strong travel advisory&quot; for the area, as the nation&apos;s largest city quickly becomes an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump said he had directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue the travel advisory and that more details would be released later in the evening. He said he had made the decision in consultation with the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. </p>
<p>
     Later Saturday, the CDC issued a travel advisory urging residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to &quot;refrain from non-essential domestic travel&quot; for 14 days, effective immediately. The advisory doesn&apos;t apply to those in critical infrastructure industries, including truckers and health professionals. </p>
<p>
     The president&apos;s assertion earlier in the day that he was considering imposing a quarantine on those states for a few weeks drew swift and harsh blowback from governors, who questioned why they hadn&apos;t been consulted first and suggested they didn&apos;t believe the move would be legal. </p>
<p>
     New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had called the quarantine idea a &quot;declaration of war on states&quot; that would crash financial markets and results in legal challenges. </p>
<p>
     &quot;A lockdown is what they did in Wuhan, China, and we&apos;re not in China,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said on CNN Saturday evening. </p>
<p>
     The president had indicated he didn&apos;t plan to physically prevent people from leaving those states, telling reporters earlier in the day that it wouldn&apos;t be necessary to bring in the military or the National Guard. The president&apos;s advisers have told him that most people would listen to an order from the president not to leave the states, and that it wouldn&apos;t be necessary to &quot;bring the hammer&quot; by physically blocking their exit, a person familiar with the discussions said. </p>
<p>
     A quarantine restricting people&apos;s movement across state lines would have represented one of the toughest measures the federal government has taken yet to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Mr. Trump already has blocked flights from China and much of Europe and asked Americans to adhere to social-distancing recommendations, but the stay-home measures that affect people most deeply have been ordered by governors. </p>
<p>
     New York City alone has more than 23,000 cases, nearly a quarter of all the cases in the country. Overall, New York state leads the country in infections, with 52,318 confirmed cases and 728 deaths as of Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said during an afternoon briefing. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo and the Democratic governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, Phil Murphy and Ned Lamont, already have ordered all nonessential businesses in the state to close and called for residents to stay home. Essential services like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies remain open under the order, and residents still can go outside for exercise and to obtain groceries. </p>
<p>
     They each said their moves already represent aggressive action against the virus&apos;s spread. &quot;Until further notified we are going to keep doing exactly what we are doing,&quot; said Mr. Murphy, whose state has 11,124 coronavirus cases as of Saturday afternoon and 140 deaths. </p>
<p>
     &quot;I look forward to speaking to the President directly about his comments and any further enforcement actions, because confusion leads to panic,&quot; Mr. Lamont said in a statement. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump&apos;s idea also took federal transportation officials by surprise. Federal transportation agencies, airline officials and pilot unions that would have been an important component of a quarantine weren&apos;t informed about Mr. Trump&apos;s idea before the president revealed it to reporters Saturday, according to people tracking the issue. </p>
<p>
     Concerns have mounted in other parts of the country about people leaving the New York City area and possibly spreading coronavirus. Earlier this week, administration officials urged anyone leaving New York to self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Monday directing travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to self-isolate for that period, and said violations of the order would amount to a criminal offense. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo on Thursday issued a similar order. Mr. Trump said on Saturday he had spoken to Mr. DeSantis. </p>
<p>
     &quot;They&apos;re having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers going down,&quot; Mr. Trump said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Cuomo said other states&apos; measures to keep New Yorkers out were &quot;reactionary.&quot; He said he would sue Rhode Island if it doesn&apos;t stop enforcing travel restrictions on New Yorkers. </p>
<p>
     Legal experts differed on whether the federal government could restrict, en masse, the movements of New York City area residents. </p>
<p>
     Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said the quarantine broached by Mr. Trump would be unconstitutional and unprecedented. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The power to regulate interstate commerce, including the spread of infectious diseases, resides exclusively in Congress,&quot; he said. &quot;In this case, the president hasn&apos;t even consulted Congress or the governor of New York. He&apos;d be acting unilaterally in ways he has no power to do.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Mr. Gostin said governors, like Mr. Cuomo, would have multiple ways to push back if Mr. Trump ordered a quarantine of their states. They could sue, and they could direct the state police and public-health authorities not to enforce the order. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The Supreme Court has said expressly that the federal government has no power to direct a governor to execute the president&apos;s orders,&quot; Mr. Gostin said. &quot;The president would have to call in the United States military to guard the border.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Wendy Parmet, a public-health law professor at Northeastern University in Boston, said the executive branch has broad powers to protect the public health. Restrictions on interstate travel and commerce should, constitutionally, be put in place by the federal government, not individual states, she said. </p>
<p>
     &quot;We&apos;re not supposed to have Florida saying drop dead to New York,&quot; she said. &quot;States can&apos;t set up borders. We have a Constitution.&quot; </p>
<p>
     She said whether any plan to quarantine the tri-state area passed constitutional muster would depend on the details of how it was done, and would have to be grounded in science about the public health. </p>
<p>
     &quot;The courts are deferential to public health powers in times of emergency,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>
     Mr. Trump&apos;s comments overshadowed his visit to Norfolk, where he sent the hospital ship, USNS Comfort, on its way to New York to help take pressure off the city&apos;s health-care system. </p>
<p>
     Standing in front of the vessel, Mr. Trump said it was &quot;stocked to the brim with equipment and medicines and everything you can think of.&quot; </p>
<p>
     &quot;This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the people of New York,&quot; he said. He reminded Americans that anyone leaving New York must self-isolate for 14 days. </p>
<p>
     The U.S. added more than 15,000 cases of the Covid-19 disease, pushing the total past 104,000 on Saturday, with a surge of cases in New York amid increased testing. There are now more than 2,000 deaths from the virus in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. </p>
<p>
     In a sign that other states were coming under pressure, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said coronavirus patients admitted to intensive-care units had doubled to 410 on Saturday. Hospitalizations were up 38.6% from a day earlier, with more than 1,000 Covid-19 patients now in California hospitals. </p>
<p>
     &quot;That&apos;s a significant, sizable increase,&quot; he said. &quot;If trends continue on those lines, then we will begin to manifest conditions that are very familiar to people on the East Coast.&quot; </p>
<p>
     Authorities also reported the death of a New York Police Department detective and an Illinois infant who had Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. </p>
<p>
     The virus&apos;s growth in the U.S. outstripped that of Italy and China, the countries with the second- and third-most infections, where confirmed cases stayed around 86,000 and 81,000, respectively, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. </p>
<p>
     As a result, the number of confirmed infections globally has more than doubled over the past week to more than 600,000. The death toll from the pathogen rose to more than 28,000 on Saturday, with roughly one-third of the fatalities in Italy, data from Johns Hopkins showed. </p>
<p>
     Italy&apos;s death toll from the virus on Friday rose by 919 to 9,134, the highest daily tally on record. Total infections there rose to 86,498, a 7% increase from the previous day. </p>
